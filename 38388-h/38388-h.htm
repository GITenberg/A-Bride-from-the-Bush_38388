<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">A LETTER FROM ALFRED</span></h2>


<p>There was consternation in the domestic
camp of Mr Justice Bligh on the banks of
the Thames. It was a Sunday morning
in early summer. Three-fourths of the family
sat in ominous silence before the mockery
of a well-spread breakfast-table: Sir James
and Lady Bligh and their second son, Granville.
The eldest son&mdash;the missing complement
of this family of four&mdash;was abroad. For many
months back, and, in fact, down to this very
minute, it had been pretty confidently believed
that the young man was somewhere in
the wilds of Australia; no one had quite
known where, for the young man, like most
vagabond young men, was a terribly meagre
corespondent; nor had it ever been clear why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
any one with leisure and money, and of
no very romantic turn, should have left
the beaten track of globe-trotters, penetrated
to the wilderness, and stayed there&mdash;as Alfred
Bligh had done. Now, however, all was
plain. A letter from Brindisi, just received,
explained everything; Alfred&rsquo;s movements,
so long obscure, were at last revealed, and in
a lurid light&mdash;that, as it were, of the bombshell
that had fallen and burst upon the Judge&rsquo;s
breakfast-table. For Alfred was on his way to
England with an Australian wife; and this
letter from Brindisi, was the first that his
people had heard of it, or of her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, in her calm
and thoughtful manner, &lsquo;it was bound to
happen sooner or later. It might have
happened very much sooner; and, indeed,
I often wished that it would; for Alfred must
be&mdash;what? Thirty?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said Granville; &lsquo;I am nearly that
myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh gently, looking
tenderly at the Judge (whose grave eyes
rested upon the sunlit lawn outside), &lsquo;from
one point of view&mdash;a selfish one&mdash;we ought
to consider ourselves the most fortunate of
parents. And this news should be a matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
for rejoicing, as it would be, if&mdash;if it were
only less sudden, and wild, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her voice trembled; she could not go on.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And alarming,&rsquo; added Granville briskly,
pulling himself together and taking an egg.</p>

<p>Then the Judge spoke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should like,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to hear the letter
read slowly from beginning to end. Between
us, we have not yet given it a fair chance;
we have got only the drift of it; we may
have overlooked something. Granville, perhaps
you will read the letter aloud to your
mother and me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville, who had just laid open his egg
with great skill, experienced a moment&rsquo;s
natural annoyance at the interruption. To
stop to read a long letter now was, he felt,
treating a good appetite shabbily, to say
nothing of the egg. But this was not a
powerful feeling; he concealed it. He had a
far stronger appetite than the mere relish for
food; the intellectual one. Granville had
one of the nicest intellects at the Junior Bar.
His intellectual appetite was so hearty, and
even voracious, that it could be gratified at
all times and places, and not only by the
loaves and fishes of full-bodied wit, but by
the crumbs and fishbones of legal humour&mdash;such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
as the reading aloud of indifferent
English and ridiculous sentiments in tones
suitable to the most chaste and classic prose.
This he had done in court with infinite gusto,
and he did it now as he would have done it
in court.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My dear Mother&rdquo;&rsquo; (he began reading,
through a single eyeglass that became him
rather well),&mdash;&lsquo;&ldquo;Before you open this letter
you&rsquo;ll see that I&rsquo;m on my way home! I am
sorry I haven&rsquo;t written you for so long, and
<em>very</em> sorry I didn&rsquo;t before I sailed. I should
think when I last wrote was from Bindarra.
But I must come at once to my great news&mdash;which
Heaven knows how I&rsquo;m to tell you,
and how you&rsquo;ll take it when I do. Well, I
will, in two words&mdash;the fact is, <em>I&rsquo;m married</em>!
My wife is the daughter of &lsquo;the boss of
Bindarra&rsquo;&mdash;in other words, a &lsquo;squatter&rsquo; with
a &lsquo;run&rsquo; (or territory) as big as a good many
English counties.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The crisp forensic tones were dropped for
an explanatory aside. &lsquo;He evidently <em>means</em>&mdash;father&rsquo;
(Granville nearly said &lsquo;my lord,&rsquo;
through force of habit), &lsquo;that his father-in-law
is the squatter; not his wife, which is what
he <em>says</em>. He writes in such a slipshod style.
I should also think he means that the territory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
in question is equal in size to certain English
counties, individually (though this I venture
to doubt), and not&mdash;what you would infer&mdash;to
several counties put together. His literary
manner was always detestable, poor old chap;
and, of course, Australia was hardly likely to
improve it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The interpolation was not exactly ill-natured;
but it was received in silence; and
Granville&rsquo;s tones, as he resumed the reading,
were even more studiously unsympathetic
than before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Of my Bride I will say very little; for
you will see her in a week at most. As for
myself, I can only tell you, dear Mother, that
I am the very luckiest and happiest man on
earth!&rdquo;&rsquo; (&lsquo;A brave statement,&rsquo; Granville
murmured in parenthesis; &lsquo;but they all make
it.&rsquo;) &lsquo;&ldquo;She is typically Australian, having
indeed been born and bred in the Bush, and
is the first to admit it, being properly proud
of her native land; but, if you knew the
Australians as I do, this would not frighten
you. Far from it, for the typical Australian
is one of the very highest if not <em>the</em> highest
development of our species.&rdquo;&rsquo; (Granville read
that sentence with impressive gravity, and
with such deference to the next as to suggest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
no kind of punctuation, since the writer
had neglected it.) &lsquo;&ldquo;But as you, my dear
Mother, are the very last person in the world
to be prejudiced by mere mannerisms, I won&rsquo;t
deny that she has one or two&mdash;<em>though, mind
you, I like them!</em> And, at least, you may look
forward to seeing the most beautiful woman
you ever saw in your life&mdash;though I say
it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Feeling sure that you will, as usual, be
&lsquo;summering&rsquo; at Twickenham, I make equally
sure that you will be able and willing to find
room for us; at the same time, we will at
once commence looking out for a little place
of our own in the country, with regard to
which we have plans which will keep till
we see you. But, while we are with
you, I thought I would be able to show
my dear girl the principal sights of the
Old Country, which, of course, are mostly
in or near town, and which she is dying
to see.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Dear Mother, I know I <em>ought</em> to have
consulted you, or at least told you, beforehand.
The whole thing was impulsive, I admit.
But if you and my Father will forgive me
for this&mdash;take my word for it, you will soon
find out that it is all you have to forgive!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
Of course, I am writing to my Father as much
as to you in this letter&mdash;as he will be the first
to understand. With dearest love to you both
(not forgetting Gran), in which Gladys joins me
(though she doesn&rsquo;t know I am saying so).</p>

<p class="sig">&lsquo;&ldquo;Believe me as ever,<br />
<br />
&lsquo;&ldquo;Your affectionate Son,<br />
<br />
<span class="padleft">&lsquo;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said the Judge, shortly.</p>

<p>The soft dark eyes of Lady Bligh were
wet with tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; she said, gently, &lsquo;it is a very
tender letter. I know of no man but Alfred
that could write such a boyish, simple letter&mdash;not
that I don&rsquo;t enjoy your clever ones, Gran.
But then Alfred never yet wrote to me
without writing himself down the dear, true-hearted,
affectionate fellow he is; only here,
of course, it comes out doubly. But does he not
mention her maiden name?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Granville. &lsquo;You
remarked the Christian name, though?
Gladys! I must say it sounds unpromising.
Mary, Eliza, Maria&mdash;&mdash;one would have rather
liked a plain, homely, farm-yard sort of name
for a squatter&rsquo;s daughter. But Ermyntrude,
or Elaine, or Gladys! These are names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
ill-omen; you expect de Vere coming after
them, or even worse.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What <em>is</em> a squatter, Gran?&rsquo; asked Lady
Bligh abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A squatter? I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Gran,
paring the ham daintily as he answered. &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure; something to do with
bushranging, I should imagine&mdash;but I really
can&rsquo;t tell you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But there was a set of common subjects
of which Gran was profoundly and intentionally
ignorant; and it happened that Greater
Britain was one of them. If he had known
for certain whether Sydney (for instance) was
a town or a colony or an island, he would
have kept the knowledge carefully to himself,
and been thoroughly ashamed of it. And it
was the same with other subjects understanded
of the Board-scholars. This queer
temper of mind is not indeed worth analysing;
nevertheless, it is peculiar to a certain sort
of clever young fellows, and Granville Bligh
was a very fair specimen of the clever young
fellow. He was getting on excellently at
the Bar, for so young a man. He also wrote
a little, with plenty of impudence and epigram,
if nothing else. But this was not his real
line. Still, what he did at all, he did more or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
less cleverly. There was cleverness in every
line of his smooth dark face; there was uncommon
shrewdness in his clear gray eyes.
His father had the same face and the same
eyes&mdash;with this difference added to the differences
naturally due to age: there were wisdom,
and dignity, and humanity in the face and
glance of the Judge; but the nobility of
expression thus given was not inherited by
the Judge&rsquo;s younger son.</p>

<p>The Judge spoke again, breaking a silence
of some minutes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you say, Mildred, it seems to have
been all very wild and sudden; but when we
have said this, we have probably said the
worst there is to say. At least, let us hope
so. Of my own knowledge many men have
gone to Australia, as Alfred went, and come
back with the best of wives. I seem to have
heard, Granville, that that is what Merivale
did; and I have met few more admirable
women than Mrs Merivale.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It certainly is the case, sir,&rsquo; said Granville,
who had been patronised to some extent
by Merivale, Q.C. &lsquo;But Mrs Merivale was
scarcely &ldquo;born and bred in the Bush&rdquo;; and
if she had what poor Alfred, perhaps euphemistically,
calls &ldquo;mannerisms&rdquo;&mdash;I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
detected no traces of any myself&mdash;when
Merivale married her, at least she had
money.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your sister-in-law may have &ldquo;money,&rdquo;
too,&rsquo; said Sir James, with somewhat scornful
emphasis. &lsquo;That is of no consequence at all.
Your brother has enough for both, and more
than enough for a bachelor.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There was no need to remind the young
man of that; it had been a sore point, and
even a raw one, with Granville since his boyhood;
for it was when the brothers were at
school together&mdash;the younger in the Sixth
Form, the elder in the Lower Fifth&mdash;and it
was already plain which one would benefit
the most by &lsquo;private means,&rsquo; that a relative
of Sir James had died, leaving all her money
to Alfred.</p>

<p>Granville coloured slightly&mdash;very slightly&mdash;but
observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a good thing he has.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; the Judge asked,
with some asperity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That he needs it,&rsquo; said Granville, significantly.</p>

<p>Sir James let the matter drop, and presently,
getting up, went out by the open
French window, and on to the lawn. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
was not his habit to snub his son; he left
that to the other judges, in court. But Lady
Bligh remonstrated in her own quiet way&mdash;a
way that had some effect even upon
Granville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To sneer at your brother&rsquo;s inferior wits,
my son, is not in quite nice taste,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;and I may tell you, now, that I did not at
all care for your comments upon his letter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville leant back in his chair and
laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How seriously you take one this morning!
But it is small wonder that you should,
for the occasion is a sufficiently serious one,
in all conscience; and indeed, dear mother,
I am as much put out as you are. Nay,&rsquo;
Granville added, smiling blandly, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t say
that you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> put out, for I can see that
you <em>are</em>. And we have reason to be put out&rsquo;&mdash;he
became righteously indignant&mdash;&lsquo;all of
us. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought it of Alfred,
I wouldn&rsquo;t indeed! No matter whom he
wanted to marry, he ought at least to have
written first, instead of being in such a
violent hurry to bring her over. It is treating
<em>you</em>, dear mother, to say the best of it,
badly; and as for the Judge, it is plain that
he is quite upset by the unfortunate affair.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
&lsquo;We have no right to assume that it is
unfortunate, Gran.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I hope it is not, that&rsquo;s <em>all</em>,&rsquo; said
Gran, with great emphasis. &lsquo;I hope it is
not, for poor Alfred&rsquo;s sake. Yet, as you
know, mother, he&rsquo;s the very kind of old chap
to get taken in and imposed upon; and&mdash;I
tell you frankly&mdash;I tremble for him. If he
is the victim of a designing woman, I am
sorry for him, from my soul I am! If he has
married in haste&mdash;and he has&mdash;to repent at
leisure&mdash;as he may&mdash;though this is trite and
detestable language, I pity him, from my soul
I do! You have already rebuked me&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t say unjustly&mdash;for making what, I admit,
had the appearance of an odious and egotistical
comparison; I will guard against
conveying a second impression of that kind;
yet I think I may safely say, without bragging,
that I know the world rather better
than old Alfred does. Well, I have, I will
not say my fears, but my dreads; and I
cannot help having them. If they are
realised, no one will sympathise with poor
dear Alfred more deeply than I shall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh looked keenly at her eloquent
son; a half-smile played about her lips: she
understood him, to some extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
&lsquo;But what if your fears are <em>not</em> realised?&rsquo;
she said, quietly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said Gran, less fluently,
&lsquo;then I&mdash;oh, of course, I shall be delighted
beyond words; no one will be more delighted
than I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you shall see,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh,
rising, with a sweet and hopeful smile, &lsquo;that
is how it is going to turn out; I have a
presentiment that it will all turn out for the
best. So there is only one thing to be done&mdash;we
must prepare to welcome her to our
hearts!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville shrugged his shoulders, but his
mother did not see him; she had gone quietly
from the room and was already climbing
(slowly, for she was stout) the stairs that led
up to her own snuggery on the first floor.
This little room was less of a boudoir than
a study, and more like an office than either,
for it was really a rather bare little room.
Its most substantial piece of furniture was
a large unlovely office-table, and its one
picture was framed in the window-sashes&mdash;a
changeful picture of sky and trees, and lawn
and river, painted this morning in the most
radiant tints of early summer. At the office-table,
which was littered with letters and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
pamphlets, Lady Bligh spent diligent hours
every day. She was a person of both mental
and manual activity, with public sympathies
and interests that entailed an immense
correspondence. She was, indeed, one of the
most charitable and benevolent of women,
and was to some extent a public woman.
But we have nothing to do with her public
life, and, on this Sunday morning, no more
had she.</p>

<p>There were no pictures on the walls, but
there were photographs upon the chimney-piece.
Lady Bligh stood looking at them
for an unusually long time&mdash;in fact, until the
sound of the old church bells, coming in
through the open window, called her away.</p>

<p>One of the photographs was of the Judge&mdash;an
excellent one, in which the dear old
gentleman looked his very best, dignified
but kindly. Another was a far too flattering
portrait of Granville. A third portrait was
that of an honest, well-meaning, and rather
handsome face, with calm dark eyes, exactly
like Lady Bligh&rsquo;s; and this was the erratic
Alfred. But the photograph that Lady Bligh
looked at longest, and most fondly, was a
faded one of Alfred and Granville as mere
schoolboys. She loved her two sons so dearly!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
One of them was much changed, and becoming
somewhat spoilt, to phrase it mildly;
yet that son was rather clever, and his mother
saw his talents through a strong binocular,
and his faults with her eyes at the wrong
end of it; and she loved him in spite of
the change in him, and listened&mdash;at least
with tolerance&mdash;to the airings of a wit that
was always less good natured, and generally
less keen, than she imagined it. But the
other son had never changed at all; even his
present fatal letter showed that. He was still
a boy at heart&mdash;a wild, stupid, affectionate
schoolboy. There was no denying it: in his
mother&rsquo;s heart the elder son was the best
beloved of the two.</p>

<p>And it was this one who had married with
so much haste and mystery&mdash;the favourite
son, the son with money, the son who
might have married any one he pleased.
It was hard to choke down prejudice when
this son was bringing home a wife from the
Bush, of all places!</p>

<p>What would she be like? What <em>could</em>
she be like?</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">HOME IN STYLE</span></h2>


<p>&lsquo;He must be mad!&rsquo; said Granville, flourishing
a telegram in his hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He must be very fond of her,&rsquo; Lady Bligh
replied, simply.</p>

<p>Granville held the telegram at arm&rsquo;s length,
and slowly focussed it with his eyeglass. He
had already declaimed it twice, once with
horror in his voice, once with a running
accompaniment of agreeable raillery. His
third reading was purely compassionate, in
accordance with his latest theory regarding
the mental condition of the sender.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Arrived both well. Chartered launch
take us Gravesend Twickenham; show her
river. Join us if possible Westminster Bridge
3 o&rsquo;clock.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alfred.</span>&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
Granville sighed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you comprehend it, dear mother? I
think I do, at last, though the prepositions <em>are</em>
left to the imagination. He has saved at
least twopence over those prepositions&mdash;which,
of course, is an item, even in a ten-pound
job.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say it will cost him
ten pounds?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Every penny of it: it would cost you or
me, or any ordinary person, at least a fiver.
I am allowing for Alfred&rsquo;s being let in rather
further than any one else would be.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At all events,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, &lsquo;you will
do what he asks you; you will be at Westminster
at the time he mentions?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;Certainly,
if you wish it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think it would be kind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I will go, by all means.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you&mdash;and Granville! I do wish
you would give up sneering at your brother&rsquo;s
peculiarities. He <em>does</em> do odd and impulsive
things, we know; and there is no denying the
extravagance of steaming up the river all the
way from Gravesend. But, after all, he has
money, and no doubt he wants to show his
wife the Thames, and to bring her home in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
pleasant fashion, full of pleasant impressions;
and upon my word,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, &lsquo;I
never heard of a prettier plan in my life! So
go, my dear boy, and meet them, and make
them happier still. If that is possible, no
one could do it more gracefully than you,
Gran!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville acknowledged the compliment,
and promised; and punctually at three he
was at Westminster Bridge, watching with
considerable interest the rapid approach of
a large launch&mdash;a ridiculously large one for
the small number of people on board. She
had, in fact, only two passengers, though
there was room for fifty. One of the two was
Alfred, whose lanky figure was unmistakable
at any distance; and the dark, straight, strapping
young woman at his side was, of course,
Alfred&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>The meeting between the brothers was
hearty enough, but it might have been more
entirely cordial had there been a little less
effusiveness on one side&mdash;not Granville&rsquo;s.
But Alfred&mdash;who was dressed in rough tweed
clothes of indeterminate cut, and had disfigured
himself with a beard&mdash;was so demonstrative
in his greeting that the younger
brother could not help glancing anxiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
round to assure himself that there was no one
about who knew him. It was a relief to him
to be released and introduced to the Bride.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladys, this is Gran come to meet us&mdash;as
I knew he would&mdash;like the brick he is, and
always was!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gran was conscious of being scrutinised
keenly by the finest dark eyes he had ever
encountered in his life; but the next moment
he was shaking his sister-in-law&rsquo;s hand, and
felt that it was a large hand&mdash;a trifling discovery
that filled Granville with a subtile
sense of satisfaction. But the Bride was yet
to open her lips.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How do you do?&rsquo; she said, the olive tint
of her cheek deepening slightly. &lsquo;It was
awfully nice of you to come; I <em>am</em> glad to see
you&mdash;I have heard such lots about you, you
know!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was said so glibly that the little speech
was not, perhaps, exactly extempore: and it
was spoken&mdash;every word of it&mdash;with a twang
that, to sensitive ears like Granville&rsquo;s, was
simply lacerating. Granville winced, and involuntarily
dropped his eyeglass; but otherwise
he kept a courteous countenance, and
made a sufficiently civil reply.</p>

<p>As for Alfred, he, of course, noticed nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
unusual in his wife&rsquo;s accents; he was used to
them; and, indeed, it seemed to Granville
that Alfred spoke with a regrettable drawl
himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to play showman, Gran,&rsquo; said
he, when some natural questions had been
hurriedly put and tersely answered (by which
time they were opposite Lambeth Palace).
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying, but I&rsquo;m a poor hand at it;
indeed, I&rsquo;m a poor Londoner, and always was:
below Blackfriars I was quite at sea, and
from here to Richmond I&rsquo;m as ignorant as a
brush.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; he&rsquo;s no good at all,&rsquo; chimed in the
Bride, pleasantly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not well up in it, either,&rsquo; said
Gran, warily.</p>

<p>This was untrue, however. Granville knew
his Thames better than most men&mdash;it was one
of the things he <em>did</em> know. But he had a
scholar&rsquo;s reverence for classic ground; and in
a young man who revered so very little, this
was remarkable, if it was not affectation.
Granville would have suffered tortures rather
than gravely point out historic spots to a
person whose ideas of history probably went
no farther back than the old Colonial digging
days; he would have poured sovereigns into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
the sea as readily as the coin of sacred associations
into Gothic ears. At least, so he
afterwards said, when defending his objection
to interpreting the Thames for his sister-in-law&rsquo;s
benefit.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What nonsense!&rsquo; cried Alfred, good-humouredly.
&lsquo;You know all about it&mdash;at all
events, you used to. There&mdash;we&rsquo;ve gone and
let her miss Lambeth Palace! Look, dear,
quick, while it&rsquo;s still in sight&mdash;that&rsquo;s where
the Archbishop of Canterbury hangs out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Gladys, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of <em>him</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And isn&rsquo;t that Cheyne Walk, or some
such place, that we&rsquo;re coming to on the right
there?&rsquo; said Alfred.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Granville, briefly; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
Cheyne Walk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Luckily the Bride asked no questions&mdash;indeed,
she was inclined to be silent&mdash;for of
all localities impossible to discuss with an
uneducated person, Granville felt that Chelsea
and Cheyne Walk were the most completely
out of the question. And that the Bride was
a sadly uneducated person was sufficiently
clear, if only from her manner of speaking.
Granville accepted the fact with creditable
equanimity&mdash;he had prophesied as much&mdash;and
sat down to smoke a cigarette and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
diagnose, if he could, this new and wonderful
dialect of his sister-in-law. It was neither
Cockney nor Yankee, but a nasal blend of
both: it was a lingo that declined to let the
vowels run alone, but trotted them out in ill-matched
couples, with discordant and awful
consequences; in a word, it was Australasiatic
of the worst description. Nor was
the speech of Alfred free from the taint&mdash;Alfred,
whose pronunciation at least had been
correct before he went out; while the common
colloquialisms of the pair made Granville
shudder.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I did not hope for such surprisingly
good looks,&rsquo; said he to himself, &lsquo;yet even <em>I</em>
was not prepared for <em>quite</em> so much vulgarity!
Poor dear Alfred!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Granville sighed, complacently.</p>

<p>Yet, as she leant upon the rail in the
summer sunlight, silent and pensive, there
was certainly no suggestion of vulgarity in
her attitude; it was rather one of unstudied
grace and ease. Nor was there anything
at all vulgar in the quiet travelling dress
that fitted her tall full form so closely and so
well. Nor was her black hair cut down to
within an inch of her eyebrows&mdash;as, of course,
it should have been&mdash;or worn in a fringe at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
all. Nor was there anything the least objectionable
in the poise of the small graceful head,
or in the glance of the bold dark eyes,
or in the set of the full, firm, crimson lips;
and thus three more excellent openings&mdash;for
the display of vulgarity&mdash;were completely
thrown away. In fact, if she had never
spoken, Granville would have been at a loss
to find a single fault in her. Alas! about her
speech there could be no two opinions&mdash;it
bewrayed her.</p>

<p>Presently Alfred sat down beside his
brother, and began to tell him everything,
and did all the talking; while the Bride still
stood watching the shifting panorama of the
banks, and the golden sunlight upon the
water, and the marvellous green of all green
things. It was practically her first experience
of this colour. And still she asked no
questions, her interest being perhaps too
intense; and so the showman-business was
forgotten, to the great relief of Granville;
and the time slipped quickly by. At last&mdash;and
quite suddenly&mdash;the Bride clapped
her hands, and turned with sparkling eyes
to her husband: they had entered that
splendid reach below Richmond, and the
bridges were in sight, with the hill beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
&lsquo;I give this best!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;It <em>does</em>
knock spots out of the Yarra and the Murray
after all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred glanced uneasily at his brother,
but found an impassive face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, old fellow,&rsquo; said Alfred, &lsquo;do your
duty; jump up and tell her about these
places.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So at last Granville made an effort to do
so; he got up and went to the side of the
Bride; and presently he was exercising a
discreet if not a delicate vein of irony, that
was peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was Kew we passed just now&mdash;you
must see the gardens there,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and
this is Richmond.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kew and Richmond!&rsquo; exclaimed the Bride,
innocently. &lsquo;How rum! We have a Kew
and a Richmond in Melbourne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Gran. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy the theft
was on our side. But look at this gray old
bridge&mdash;picturesque, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and I dare
say you have nothing like it out there. And
there, you see&mdash;up on the left yonder&mdash;is
Richmond Hill. Rather celebrated, Richmond
Hill: you may have heard of it; there was
a lass that lived there once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;what of her?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
&lsquo;Oh, she was neat and had sweet eyes&mdash;or
sweet, with neat eyes&mdash;I really forget
which. And there was a somebody or other
who said he&rsquo;d resign any amount of crowns&mdash;the
number wasn&rsquo;t specified&mdash;to call her
his. He was pretty safe in saying that&mdash;unless,
indeed, he meant crown-<em>pieces</em>&mdash;which,
now I think of it, would be rather an original
reading.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alfred,&rsquo; said the Bride abruptly, &lsquo;are we
nearly there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not far off,&rsquo; said Alfred.</p>

<p>Granville bit his lip. &lsquo;We are very nearly
there,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;this is the beginning of
Twickenham.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then where&rsquo;s the Ferry?&rsquo; said the Bride.
&lsquo;I know all about &ldquo;Twickenham Ferry&rdquo;;
we once had a storekeeper&mdash;a new chum&mdash;who
used to sing about it like mad. Show
it me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There, then: it crosses by the foot of the
island: it&rsquo;s about to cross now. Now, in a
minute, I&rsquo;ll show you Pope&rsquo;s old place; we
don&rsquo;t go quite so far&mdash;in fact, here we are&mdash;
but you&rsquo;ll be able just to see it, I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Pope!&rsquo; said Gladys. &lsquo;I never knew
<em>he</em> lived in England!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No more he does. Not <em>the</em> Pope&mdash;<em>Pope</em>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
a man of the name of Pope: a scribbler:
a writing-man: in fact, a poet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The three were leaning over the rail,
shoulder to shoulder, and watching eagerly
for the first glimpse of the Judge&rsquo;s retreat
through the intervening trees. Granville was
in the middle. The Bride glanced at him
sharply, and opened her lips to say something
which&mdash;judging by the sudden gleam of her
dark eyes&mdash;might possibly have been rather
too plain-spoken. But she never said it; she
merely left Granville&rsquo;s side, and went round to
the far side of her husband, and slipped her
hand through his arm. Granville walked
away.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are we there?&rsquo; whispered Gladys.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just, my darling. Look, that&rsquo;s the house&mdash;the
one with the tall trees and the narrow
lawn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Hoo-jolly-ray!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hush, Gladdie! For Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t
say anything like that before my mother!
There she is on the lawn, waving her handkerchief.
We&rsquo;ll wave ours back to her. The
dear mother! Whatever you do, darling
girl, don&rsquo;t say anything of that sort to <em>her</em>.
It would be Greek to my mother and the
Judge, and they mightn&rsquo;t like it.&rsquo;</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">PINS AND NEEDLES</span></h2>


<p>Slanting mellow sunbeams fell pleasantly
upon the animated face of the Bride, as she
stepped lightly across the gangway from the
steam-launch to the lawn; and, for one
moment, her tall supple figure stood out
strikingly against the silver river and the
pale eastern sky. In that moment a sudden
dimness came over Lady Bligh&rsquo;s soft eyes,
and with outstretched arms she hurried
forward to press her daughter to her heart.
It was a natural motherly impulse, but, even
if Lady Bligh had stopped to think, she
would have made sure of being met half-way.
She was not, however, and the mortification
of the moment was none the less
intense because it was invisible. The Bride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
refused to be embraced. She was so tall that
it would have been impossible for Lady
Bligh to kiss her against her will, but it never
came to that; the unbending carriage and
man-like outstretched hand spoke plainly
and at once&mdash;and were understood. But
Lady Bligh coloured somewhat, and it was
an unfortunate beginning, for every one
noticed it; and the Judge, who was hurrying
towards them across the lawn at the
time, there and then added a hundred per
cent of ceremony to his own greeting, and
received his daughter-in-law as he would
have received any other stranger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am very happy to see you,&rsquo; he said,
when Alfred had introduced them&mdash;the
Judge waited for that. &lsquo;Welcome, indeed;
and I hope you have received agreeable impressions
of our River Thames.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, rather!&rsquo; said Gladys, smiling unabashed
upon the old gentleman. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve no
rivers like it in Australia. I&rsquo;ve just been
saying so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville, who had been watching for
a change in his mother&rsquo;s expression when
she should first hear the Bride speak, was
not disappointed. Lady Bligh winced perceptibly.
Judges, however, may be relied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
upon to keep their countenances, if anybody
may; it is their business; Sir James was
noted for it, and he merely said dryly, &lsquo;I
suppose not,&rsquo; and that was all.</p>

<p>And then they all walked up the lawn
together to where tea awaited them in the
veranda. The Bride&rsquo;s dark eyes grew
round at sight of the gleaming silver teapot
and dainty Dresden china; she took her
seat in silence in a low wicker chair, while
the others talked around her; but presently
she was heard exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, thanks, no milk, and I&rsquo;ll sweeten it
myself, please.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s cream,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, good-naturedly,
pausing with the cream-jug in
the air.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The same thing,&rsquo; returned Gladys. &lsquo;We
never took any on the station, so I like it
better without; and it can&rsquo;t be too strong,
if you please. We didn&rsquo;t take milk,&rsquo; she
turned to explain to Sir James, &lsquo;because, in
a general way, our only cow was a tin one,
and we preferred no milk at all. We ran
sheep, you see, not cattle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A tin cow!&rsquo; said Sir James.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She means they only had condensed
milk,&rsquo; said Alfred, roaring with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
&lsquo;But our cow is <em>not</em> tin,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh,
smiling, as she still poised the cream-jug;
&lsquo;will you not change your mind?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, thanks,&rsquo; said the Bride stoutly.</p>

<p>It was another rather awkward moment,
for it did seem as though Gladys was disagreeably
independent. And Alfred, of all
people, made the moment more awkward
still, and, indeed, more uncomfortable than
any that had preceded it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladdie,&rsquo; he exclaimed in his airiest manner,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;re a savage! A regular savage,
as I&rsquo;ve told you over and over
again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>No one said anything. Gladys smiled,
and Alfred chuckled over his pleasantry.
But it was a pleasantry that contained a
most unpleasant truth. The others felt this,
and it made them silent. It was a relief to
all&mdash;with the possible exception of the happy
pair, neither of whom appeared to be over-burdened
with self-consciousness&mdash;when Lady
Bligh carried off Gladys, and delivered her
in her own room into the safe keeping of
Miss Bunn, her appointed maid.</p>

<p>This girl, Bunn, presently appeared in
the servants&rsquo; hall, sat down in an interesting
way, and began to twirl her thumbs with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
great ostentation. Being questioned, in fulfilment
of her artless design, she said that
she was not wanted upstairs. Being further
questioned, she rattled off a string of the
funny things Mrs &lsquo;<i>H</i>alfred&rsquo; had said to
her along with a feeble imitation of Mrs
&lsquo;<i>H</i>alfred&rsquo;s&rsquo; very funny way of saying them.
This is not a matter of importance; but
it was the making of Bunn below stairs; so
long as Mrs Alfred remained in the house, her
maid&rsquo;s popularity as a kitchen entertainer
was assured.</p>

<p>The Bride wished to be alone; at all
events she desired no personal attendance.
What should she want with a maid? A
lady&rsquo;s-maid was a &lsquo;fixing&rsquo; she did not understand,
and did not wish to understand;
she had said so plainly, and that she didn&rsquo;t
see where Miss Bunn &lsquo;came in&rsquo;; and then
Miss Bunn had gone out, in convulsions.
And now the Bride was alone at last, and
stood pensively gazing out of her open window
at the wonderful green trees and the
glittering river, at the deep cool shadows
and the pale evening sky; and delight was
in her bold black eyes; yet a certain sense of
something not quite as it ought to be&mdash;a
sensation at present vague and undefined&mdash;made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
her graver than common. And so
she stood until the door was burst suddenly
open, and a long arm curled swiftly round
her waist, and Alfred kissed her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My darling! tell me quickly&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said Gladys. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I guess
what it is you want me to tell you! Shall
I?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, if you can, for I certainly do want
you to tell me something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s what I think of your people!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How you like them,&rsquo; Alfred amended.
&lsquo;Yes, that was it. Well, then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, then&mdash;I like your mother. She has
eyes like yours, Alfred, large and still and
kind, and she is big and motherly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then, oh, my darling, why on earth
didn&rsquo;t you kiss her?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kiss her? Not <em>me</em>! Why should I?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She meant to kiss you; I saw she
did.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it! Even if she had, it
would have been only for your sake. You
wait a little bit; wait till she knows me, and
if she wants to kiss me then&mdash;let her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred was pained by his young wife&rsquo;s
tone; he had never before heard her speak
so strangely, and her eyes were wistful. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
did not quite understand her, but he did not
try to, then; he varied the subject.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How about Gran?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, that Gran!&rsquo; cried Gladys. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
suffer him at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t suffer Gran! What on earth do
you mean, Gladys?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I mean that he was just a little beast in
the boat! You think he was as glad to see
you as you were him, because you judge by
yourself; but not a bit of it; I know better.
It was all put on with him, and a small &ldquo;all&rdquo;
too. Then you asked him to tell me about
the places we passed, and he only laughed
at me. Ah, you may laugh at people without
moving a muscle, but people may see it all the
same; and I did, all along; and just before we
got here I very near told him so. If I had,
I&rsquo;d have given him one, you stake your
life!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Alfred devoutly,
but in great trouble. &lsquo;<em>I</em> never heard him
say anything to rankle like that; I thought
he was very jolly, if you ask me. And really,
Gladdie, old Gran&rsquo;s as good a fellow as ever
lived; besides which, he has all the brains of
the family.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Gladys, softening, &lsquo;my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
old man has got a double share of something
better than brains!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, darling! But at least the
Judge was pleasant; what did you think of
the Judge?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I funked him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good gracious! Why?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s so dreadfully dignified; and he
looks you through and through&mdash;not nastily,
like Gran does, but as if you were something
funny in a glass case.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What stuff and nonsense, Gladdie! You&rsquo;re
making me miserable. Look here: talk to
the Judge: draw him out a bit. That&rsquo;s all he
wants, and he likes it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What am I to call him&mdash;&ldquo;Judge&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No: not that: never that. For the
present, &ldquo;Sir James,&rdquo; I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what am I to talk about?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, anything&mdash;Australia. Interest him
about the Bush. Try, dearest, at dinner&mdash;to
please me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Gladys; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a
shot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And she had one, though it was not quite
the kind of shot Alfred would have recommended&mdash;at
any rate, not for a first shot.
For, on thinking it over, it seemed to Gladys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
that, with relation to the Bush, nothing could
interest a Judge so much as the manner of
administering the law there, which she knew
something about. Nor was the subject unpromising
or unsafe: it was only her way
of leading up to it that was open to criticism.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose, Sir James,&rsquo; she began, &lsquo;you
have lots of trying to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Trying?&rsquo; said the Judge, looking up
from his soup; for the Bride had determined
not to be behindhand in keeping her promise,
and had opened the attack thus early.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As if he were a tailor!&rsquo; thought Granville.
&lsquo;Trials, sir,&rsquo; he suggested suavely.
He was sitting next Gladys, who was on the
Judge&rsquo;s right.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, trials!&rsquo; said the Judge with a faint&mdash;a
very faint&mdash;smile. &lsquo;Oh, yes&mdash;a great
number.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A sudden thought struck Gladys. She
became the interested instead of the interesting
party. She forgot the Bush, and stared
at her father-in-law in sudden awe.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are there many murder trials among
them, Sir James?&rsquo;</p>

<p>By the deliberate manner with which he
went on with his soup, the Judge apparently
did not hear the question. But Lady Bligh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
and Alfred heard it, and were horrified; while
Granville looked grave, and listened for more
with all his ears. He had not to wait long.
Gladys feared she had expressed herself
badly, and quickly tried again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What I mean is&mdash;Sir James&mdash;do you
often have to go and put on the black cap,
and sentence poor unfortunate people to be
hung? Because that can&rsquo;t be very nice, Sir
James&mdash;is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>A faint flush mounted into the Judge&rsquo;s
pale cheeks. &lsquo;It is not of frequent occurrence,&rsquo;
he said stiffly.</p>

<p>Granville, sitting next her, might easily
have stopped his sister-in-law by a word or
a sign before this; but Alfred was practically
hidden from her by the lamp, and though he
tried very hard to kick her under the table,
he only succeeded in kicking footstools and
table-legs; and Lady Bligh was speechless.</p>

<p>The Bride, however, merely thought that
Alfred had exaggerated the ease with which
his father was to be drawn out. But she had
not given in yet. That would have been
contrary to her nature.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a good thing!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It would
be so&mdash;so horrid, if it happened <em>very</em> often,
to wake up and say to yourself, &ldquo;That poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
fellow&rsquo;s got to swing in a minute or two; and
it&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo; It would be a terror
if that was to happen every week or so;
and I&rsquo;m glad for your sake, Sir James&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly; why, it is difficult
to say, for no one had spoken; but perhaps
that was the very reason. At all events, she
remembered her experience of Bush law, and
got to her point, now, quickly enough.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was once at a trial myself, Sir James,
in the Bush,&rsquo; she said (and there was certainly
a general sense of relief). &lsquo;My own father
was boss&mdash;or Judge, if you like&mdash;that trip.
There were only four people there; the sergeant,
who was jailer and witness as well,
father, the prisoner, and me; I looked on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is your father a member of the Colonial
Bar?&rsquo; inquired Sir James, mildly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lord, no, Sir James! He&rsquo;s only a magistrate.
Why, he&rsquo;d only got to remand the
poor chap down to Cootamundra; yet he had
to consult gracious knows how many law-books
(the sergeant had them ready) to do it
properly!&rsquo;</p>

<p>They all laughed; but there was a good
deal that ought not to have been laughed at.
A moment before, when her subject was
about as unfortunate as it could have been,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
she had chosen her mere words with a certain
amount of care and good taste; but now
that she was on her native heath, and blameless
in matter, her manner had become
dreadful&mdash;her expressions were shocking&mdash;her
twang worse than ever. The one subject
that she was at home in excited her to an
unseemly degree. No sooner, then, had the
laugh subsided than Lady Bligh seized upon
the conversation, hurled it well over the head
of the Bride, and kept it there, high and dry,
until the end of dessert; then she sailed
away to the drawing-room with the unconscious
offender.</p>

<p>It was time to end this unconsciousness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, &lsquo;will you let
me give you a little lecture?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Gladys, opening her eyes
rather wide, but won at once by the old
lady&rsquo;s manner.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then, my dear, you should never interrogate
people about their professional duties,
least of all a judge. Sir James does not like it;
and even I never dream of doing it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Goodness gracious!&rsquo; cried the Bride.
&lsquo;Have I been and put my foot in it,
then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have said nothing that really matters,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
Lady Bligh replied hastily; and she determined
to keep till another time some observations
that were upon her mind on the
heads of &lsquo;slang&rsquo; and &lsquo;twang;&rsquo; for the poor
girl was blushing deeply, and seemed, at last,
thoroughly uncomfortable; which was not
what Lady Bligh wanted at all.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only, I must tell you,&rsquo; Lady Bligh continued,
&lsquo;it <em>was</em> an unfortunate choice to hit
upon the death-sentence for a subject of
conversation. All judges are sensitive about
it; Sir James is particularly so. But there!
there is nothing for you to look grieved about,
my dear. No one will think anything more
of such a trifle; and, of course, out in Australia
everything must be quite different.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys bridled up at once; she would
have no allowances made for herself at the
expense of her country. It is a point on
which Australians are uncommonly sensitive,
small blame to them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it!&rsquo; she cried vigorously.
&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t go blaming Australia,
Lady Bligh; it&rsquo;s no fault of Australia&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s
<em>my</em> fault&mdash;<em>my</em> ignorance&mdash;<em>me</em> that&rsquo;s to blame!
Oh, please to remember: whenever I do or
say anything wrong, you&rsquo;ve not to excuse
me because I&rsquo;m an Australian! Australia&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
got nothing to do with it; it&rsquo;s me that
doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s what, and has got to
learn!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her splendid eyes were full of trouble, but
not of tears. With a quick, unconscious,
supplicating gesture she turned and fled from
the room.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when Lady Bligh
followed her, she said, very briefly and independently,
that she was fatigued, and would
come down no more. And so her first evening
in England passed over.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">A TASTE OF HER QUALITY</span></h2>


<p>Mr Justice Bligh was an inveterate and
even an irreclaimable early riser. In the
pleasant months at Twickenham he became
worse in this respect than ever, and it was
no unusual thing for the slow summer dawns
to find this eminent judge, in an old tweed
suit, and with a silver frost upon his cheeks
and chin, pottering about the stables, or the
garden, or the river&rsquo;s brim.</p>

<p>The morning following the arrival of the
happy pair, however, is scarcely a case in
point, for it was fully six when Sir James sat
down in his dressing-room to be shaved by
his valet, the sober and vigilant Mr Dix.
This operation, for obvious reasons, was commonly
conducted in dead silence; nor was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
Judge ever very communicative with his
servants; so that the interlude which occurred
this morning was remarkable in itself, quite
apart from what happened afterwards.</p>

<p>A series of loud reports of the nature of fog-signals
had come suddenly through the open
window, apparently from some part of the
premises. The Judge held up his finger to
stop the shaving.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is that noise, Dix?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Please, Sir James, it sounds like some
person a-cracking of a whip, Sir James.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A whip! I don&rsquo;t think so at all. It is
more like pistol-shooting. Go to the window
and see if you can see anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, Sir James, I can&rsquo;t see nothing at all,&rsquo;
said Dix from the window; &lsquo;but it do seem
to come from the stable-yard, please, Sir
James.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never heard a whip cracked like that,&rsquo;
said the Judge. &lsquo;Dear me, how it continues!
Well, never mind; lather me afresh,
Dix.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the shaving went on; but in the stable-yard
a fantastic scene was in full play. Its
origin was in the idle behaviour of the stable-boy,
who had interrupted his proper business
of swilling the yard to crack a carriage-whip,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
by way of cheap and indolent variety. Now
you cannot crack any kind of whip well without
past practice and present pains; but
this lad, who was of a mean moral calibre,
had neither the character to practise nor the
energy to take pains in anything. He cracked
his whip as he did all things&mdash;execrably;
and, when his wrist was suddenly and firmly
seized from behind, the shock served the
young ruffian right. His jaw dropped. &lsquo;The
devil!&rsquo; he gasped; but, turning round, it
appeared that he had made a mistake&mdash;unless,
indeed, the devil had taken the form
of a dark and beautiful young lady, with bright
contemptuous eyes that made the lad shrivel
and hang his head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Anyway, <em>you</em> can&rsquo;t crack a whip!&rsquo; said
the Bride, scornfully&mdash;for of course it was no
one else.</p>

<p>The lad kept a sulky silence. The young
lady picked up the whip that had fallen from
his unnerved fingers. She looked very fresh
and buoyant in the fresh summer morning,
and very lovely. She could not have felt real
fatigue the night before, for there was not
a lingering trace of it in her appearance now;
and if she had been really tired, why be up
and out so very early this morning? The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
stable-boy began to glance at her furtively
and to ask himself this last question, while
Gladys handled and examined the whip in
a manner indicating that she had handled
a whip before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Show you how?&rsquo; she asked suddenly;
but the lad only dropped his eyes and shuffled
his feet, and became a degree more sulky
than before. Gladys stared at him in astonishment.
She was new to England, and had yet
to discover that there is a certain type of
lout&mdash;a peculiarly English type&mdash;that infinitely
prefers to be ground under heel by
its betters to being treated with the least
approach to freedom or geniality on their part.
This order of being would resent the familiarity
of an Archbishop much more bitterly than
his Grace would resent the vilest abuse of the
lout. It combines the touchiness of the
sensitive-plant with the soul of the weed; and
it was the Bride&rsquo;s first introduction to the
variety&mdash;which, indeed, does not exist in
Australia. She cracked the whip prettily,
and with a light heart, and the boy glowered
upon her. The exercise pleased her, and
brought a dull red glow into her dusky
cheeks, and heightened and set off her
beauty, so that even the lout gaped at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
with a sullen sense of satisfaction. Then,
suddenly, she threw down the whip at his
feet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Take</em> the beastly thing!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;It
isn&rsquo;t half a whip! But you just hold on,
and I&rsquo;ll show you what a real whip is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She was out of the yard in a twinkling.
The lout rubbed his eyes, scratched his head,
and whistled. Then a brilliant idea struck
him: he fetched the coachman. They were
just in time. The Bride was back in a
moment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ha! two of you, eh?&rsquo; she exclaimed.
&lsquo;Well, stand aside and I&rsquo;ll show you how
we crack stock-whips in the Bush!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A short, stout handle, tapering towards
the lash, and no longer than fifteen inches,
was in her hand. They could not see the
lash at first, because she held it in front of
her in her left hand, and it was of the same
colour as her dark tailor-made dress; but the
Bride jerked her right wrist gently, and then
a thing like an attenuated brown snake,
twelve feet long, lay stretched upon the wet
cement of the yard as if by magic. Swiftly
then she raised her arm, and the two spectators
felt a fine line of water strike their faces
as the lash came up from the wet cement;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
looking up, they saw a long black streak undulating
for an instant above the young lady&rsquo;s
head, and then they heard a whiz, followed
by an almost deafening report. The lash lay
on the ground again, quivering. Coachman
and stable-boy instinctively flattened their
backs against the coach-house door.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That,&rsquo; said the Bride, &lsquo;is the plain thing.
Smell this!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Again the long lash trembled over her
head; again it cracked like a gun-shot somewhere
in front of her, but this time, by the
help of the recoil and by the sheer strength
of her wrist, the lash darted out again behind
her&mdash;as it seemed, under her very arm&mdash;and
let out the report of a second barrel in the
rear. And this fore-and-aft recoil cracking
went on without intermission for at least
a minute&mdash;that minute during which the
Judge&rsquo;s shaving was interrupted. Then it
stopped, and there was a fine wild light in the
Bride&rsquo;s eyes, and her breath came quickly,
and her lips and cheeks were glowing
crimson.</p>

<p>The phlegmatic lad was quite speechless,
and, in fact, with his gaping mouth and
lolling tongue he presented a rather cruel
spectacle. But the coachman found an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
awestruck word or two: &lsquo;My soul and body!&rsquo;
he gasped.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the Bride, &lsquo;that <em>is</em> something
flash, ain&rsquo;t it though? I wonder I hadn&rsquo;t
forgotten it. And now <em>you</em> have a try, old
man!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Honest Garrod, the coachman, opened his
eyes wide. He knew that this was Mrs
Alfred; he had heard that Mrs Alfred was
an Australian; but he could scarcely believe
his ears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, miss&mdash;no, mum&mdash;thank you,&rsquo; he faltered.
The &lsquo;miss&rsquo; came much more naturally
than the &lsquo;mum.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; cried the Bride.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather not, miss&mdash;<em>mum</em>,&rsquo; said the
coachman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What rot!&rsquo; said Gladys. &lsquo;Here&mdash;that&rsquo;s
it&mdash;bravo! <em>Now</em> blaze away!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man had given in, simply because
this extraordinary young lady was irresistible.
The first result of his weakness
was a yell of pain from the stable-boy; the
poor lad&rsquo;s face was bleeding where the lash
had struck it. Rough apologies followed.
Then the old coachman&mdash;who was not without
mettle, and was on it, for the moment&mdash;took
off his coat and tried again. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
many futile efforts, however, he only succeeded
in coiling the lash tightly round his
own legs; and that made an end of it; the old
man gave it up.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Show us some more, mum,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
got too old and stiff for them games,&rsquo;&mdash;as
if in his youth he had been quite at home
with the stock-whip, and only of late years
had got rusty in the art of cracking it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Right you are,&rsquo; said Gladys, gaily, when
her laughter was over&mdash;she had a hearty,
but a rather musical laugh. &lsquo;Give me the
whip. Now, have you got a coin&mdash;a sixpence?
No? No odds, here&rsquo;s half a sov.
in my purse that&rsquo;ll do as well; and you shall
have it, either of you that do this side o&rsquo; Christmas
what I&rsquo;m going to do now. I&rsquo;m going
to show you a trick and a half!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled with excitement: she
was rather over-excited, perhaps. She placed
the coin upon the ground, retreated several
paces, measured the distance with her eye,
and smartly raised the handle of the stock-whip.
The crack that followed was the plain,
straightforward crack, only executed with
greater precision than before. Then she had
resembled nothing so much as an angler idly
flogging a stream; the difference was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
now, as it were, she was throwing at a rise.
And she threw with wonderful skill; for, at
the first crack, the half-sovereign spun high
into the air and fell with a ring upon the
cement; she had picked it up on the point
of the lash!</p>

<p>It was a surprising feat. That she managed
to accomplish it at the first attempt
surprised no one so much as the Bride herself.
This also added in a dangerous degree
to her excitement. She was now in little
less than a frenzy. She seemed to forget
where she was, and to think that she was back
on the station in New South Wales, where
she could do what she liked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve seen I can do that,&rsquo; she
cried to the lad, &lsquo;stand you with your back
to the wall there, and I&rsquo;ll take your hat off
for you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The answer of the dull youth was astonishingly
wise; he said nothing at all, but beat
a hasty retreat into the safety of the saddle-room.</p>

<p>She turned to the trembling Garrod. &lsquo;Then
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Even as he demurred, he saw her hand go
up. Next moment the whipcord hissed past
his face and there was a deafening report in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
his right ear, and the next a fearful explosion
just under his left ear, and many more at
every turn and corner of his face, while the
poor man stood with closed eyes and unuttered
prayers. It was an elaborate substitute
for the simpler fun of whipping his cap
off, the unhappy creature being bareheaded
already. At last, feeling himself still untouched,
Garrod opened his eyes, watched
his opportunity, and, while the lash still
quivered in mid-air, turned and made a
valiant bolt for shelter. His shirt was cut
between the shoulder-blades as cleanly as
though a knife had done it, but he reached the
saddle-room with a whole skin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ye cowardly devils!&rsquo; roared the Bride,
now beside herself&mdash;her dark eyes ablaze
with diabolical merriment. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you
there all day, so help me, if you don&rsquo;t come
out of it!&rsquo; And, in the execution of her
threat, the long lash cracked in the doorway
with terrifying echoes.</p>

<p>At that moment, wildly excited as she
was, she became conscious of a new presence
in the yard. She turned her head, to see a
somewhat mean-looking figure in ancient
tweed, with his back to the light, but apparently
regarding her closely from under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
the shadow of his broad felt wideawake.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Another of &rsquo;em, I do declare!&rsquo; cried the
Bride. And with that the lash cracked in
the ears of the unfortunate new-comer, who
stood as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>The blue sky, from this luckless person&rsquo;s
point of view, became alive with the writhings
of serpents, hell-black and numberless.
His ears were filled and stunned with the
fiendish musketry. He stood like a statue;
his hands were never lifted from the pockets
of his Norfolk jacket; he never once removed
his piercing gaze from the wild face of his
tormentor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take off your hat to a
lady?&rsquo; that lunatic now shouted, laughing
hoarsely, but never pausing in her vile work.
&lsquo;Faith, but I&rsquo;ll do it for you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The wideawake then and there spun up
into the air, even as the half-sovereign had
spun before it. And the very next instant
the stock-whip slipped from the fingers of
the Bride. She had uncovered the gray
hairs of her father-in-law, Sir James Bligh!
At the same moment there was a loud shout
behind her, and she staggered backward
almost into the arms of her horror-stricken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
husband. Even then the Bride knew that
Granville was there too, watching her misery
with grinning eyes. And the Judge did
not move a muscle, but stood as he had stood
under her fire, piercing her through and
through with his stern eyes; and there was
an expression upon his face which the worst
malefactors he had ever dealt with had perhaps
not seen there; and a terrible silence
held the air after the mad uproar of the last
few minutes.</p>

<p>That awful stillness was broken by the
patter of unsteady footsteps. With a crimson
face the Bride tottered rather than ran
across the yard, and fell upon her knees on
the wet cement, at the Judge&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Forgive me,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I never saw it was
you!&rsquo;</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">GRANVILLE ON THE SITUATION</span></h2>


<p>It was in the forenoon of the same day that
Granville entered abruptly his mother&rsquo;s sanctum.
Lady Bligh was busily writing at the
great office-table, but she looked up at once
and laid down her pen. Granville threw
himself into her easiest chair with an air of
emancipation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They have gone!&rsquo; he ejaculated. If he
had referred to the British workman or to
the bailiffs he could not have employed more
emphatic tones of relief; so Lady Bligh
naturally asked to whom he did refer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To the happy pair!&rsquo; said Granville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They have gone to town, then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To town for the day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh took up her pen again, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
only to wipe it, deliberately. &lsquo;Now, Granville,&rsquo;
she said, leaning back in her chair, &lsquo;I
want you to tell me the truth about&mdash;about
whatever happened before breakfast. I don&rsquo;t
know yet quite what did happen. I want to
get at the truth; but so far I have been able
to gather only shreds and patches of the
truth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville rose briskly to his feet and took
his stand upon the hearthrug. Then he leant
an elbow on the chimney-piece, adjusted his
eyeglass, and smiled down upon Lady Bligh.
One easily might have imagined that the task
imposed upon him was congenial in the extreme.
Without further pressing he told the
story, and told it succinctly and well, with
a zest that was vaguely felt rather than
detected, and with an entire and artistic
suppression of his usual commentaries. The
mere story was so effective in itself that the
most humorous parenthesis could not have
improved it, and Granville had the wit to
tell it simply. But when he reached the
point where the Judge appeared on the scene
Lady Bligh stopped him; Granville was disappointed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think perhaps I have been told what
happened then,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh; &lsquo;at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
events I seem to know, and I don&rsquo;t care to
hear it again. Oh! it was too scandalous!
But tell me, Gran, how did your father bear
it?&mdash;at the time, I mean.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Like a man!&rsquo; said Granville, with
righteous warmth. &lsquo;Like a man! With that
vile whip cracking under his very nose, he
did not flinch&mdash;he did not stir. Then she
whipped his hat from his head; and then she
saw what she had done, and went down on
her knees to him&mdash;as if <em>that</em> would undo it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And your father?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My father behaved splendidly; as no
other man in England in his position and&mdash;in
<em>that</em> position&mdash;would have behaved. He
told her at once, when she said she had not
seen it was he, that he quite understood
that; that, in fact, he had seen it for himself
from the first. Then he told her to get up that
instant; then he smiled&mdash;actually smiled;
and then&mdash;you will hardly believe this, but
it is a fact&mdash;he gave his arm to Mistress
Gladys and took her in to breakfast!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh sighed, but made no remark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was more than she deserved; even
Alfred admitted that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh did not answer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Even Alfred was knocked out of time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
I never saw a fellow look more put out than
he did at breakfast. He had warned us to
prepare for &ldquo;mannerisms,&rdquo; but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville made a tempting pause. Lady
Bligh, however, refused to fill it in. She was
engrossed in thought. Her line of thought
suddenly flashed across Granville, and he
caught it up dexterously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As for the Judge,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what the
Judge feels no one can say. As I said, he
behaved as only he could have behaved in
the infamous circumstances. But I did see
him steal a quiet glance at Alfred; and that
glance said plainer than words: &ldquo;<em>You&rsquo;ve</em>
done it, my boy; this is irrevocable!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh was drawn at last.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is very painful,&rsquo; she murmured;
&lsquo;this is too painful, Granville!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Painful?&rsquo; cried Granville. &lsquo;I grant you
it&rsquo;s painful; but it&rsquo;s the fact; it&rsquo;s got to be
faced.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, sadly;
&lsquo;that may be. But we ought not to be hasty;
and we certainly ought not to make too much
of this one escapade.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville shook his head wisely, and
smiled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is much fear of <em>that</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
On the contrary, I doubt if our eyes are even
yet fully open to the enormity of this morning&rsquo;s
work. I don&rsquo;t think we any of us
realise the hideous indignity to which my
father has been subjected. But we should.
We should think of it&mdash;and of him. Here
we have one of the oldest and ablest of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s judges&mdash;a man of the widest experience
and of the fairest fame, whose name
is a synonym for honour and humanity, not
only in the Profession, but throughout every
section of the community&mdash;a man, my dear
mother, with whom the very smartest of us&mdash;I
tell you frankly&mdash;would fight shy of a tilt
in court, yet whom we all respect and honour;
in very truth, &ldquo;a wise and upright judge,&rdquo;
though I say it who am his son. And what
has happened to him? How has he been
treated?&rsquo; cried Granville. &lsquo;Well, we know.
No need to go into that again. Only <em>try</em> to
realise it, dear mother; try to realise it. To
me there is, I confess, something almost epic
in this business!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to realise it; and I don&rsquo;t know,
I am sure, why you should wish to make
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For no reason,&rsquo; said Granville, shrugging
his shoulders, and also looking hurt; &lsquo;for no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
kind of reason, except that it <em>did</em> strike me
that my father&rsquo;s character had never&mdash;never,
that is, in his home life&mdash;come out more
strongly or more generously. Why, I should
like to lay ruinous odds that he never refers
to the matter again, even to you; while, you
shall see, his manner to her will not suffer
the slightest change in consequence of what
has happened.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It would be a terrible thing if it did,&rsquo;
said Lady Bligh; and she added after a
pause: &lsquo;She <em>is</em> so beautiful!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville drummed with his fingers upon
the chimney-piece. His mother wanted a
reply. She wanted sympathy upon this
point; it was a very insignificant point,
the Bride&rsquo;s personal beauty; but as yet it
seemed to be the only redeeming feature in
Alfred&rsquo;s unfortunate marriage.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t deny <em>that</em>, Gran?&rsquo; she persisted.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Deny what? The young woman&rsquo;s prepossessing
appearance? Certainly not; nobody
with eyes to see could deny that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And after all,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, &lsquo;brought
up as she evidently has been, it would be
astonishing indeed if her ways were <em>not</em> wild
and strange. Consequently, Gran, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
every hope that she will fall into our ways
very soon; is there not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, of course there is <em>hope</em>,&rsquo; said Gran,
with an emphasis that was the reverse of
hopeful; &lsquo;and there is hope, too, that she
will ultimately fall into our way of speaking:
her own &ldquo;mannerisms,&rdquo; in that respect, are
just a little too marked. Oh, yes, there is
hope; there is hope.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh said no more; she seemed to
have no more to say. Observing this, Granville
consulted his watch, said something
about an engagement in town, and went to
the door.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Going to London?&rsquo; said Lady Bligh.
&lsquo;You might have gone with them, I
think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; said Granville. &lsquo;I should
have been out of place. They were going to
Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s, or the Tower of London,
or the Zoological Gardens&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
which&mdash;perhaps to all three. But the Bride
will tell us all about it this evening and how
the sights of London compare with the sights
of Melbourne; we may look forward to that;
and, till then&mdash;good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Lady Bligh was once more alone. She
did not at once resume her correspondence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
however. Leaning back in her chair, she
gazed thoughtfully through the open window
at her side, and across the narrow lawn to
where the sunlit river was a silver band
behind the trunks and nether foliage of the
trees. Lady Bligh was sad, and no wonder;
but in her heart was little of the wounded
pride, and none of the personal bitterness,
that many mothers would feel&mdash;and do feel
every day&mdash;under similar circumstances.
What were the circumstances? Simply
these: her eldest son had married a wife who
was beautiful, it was true, and good-tempered,
it appeared; but one who was, on the other
hand, both vulgar and ignorant, and, as a
daughter, in every way impossible. These
hard words Lady Bligh pronounced deliberately
in her mind. She was facing the fact,
as Granville had said that it should be faced.
Yet Granville had used no such words as
these; if he had, he would have been given
reason to regret them.</p>

<p>For, as has been said already, Lady Bligh
had a tolerably just estimate of her son
Granville; she thought him only rather more
clever, and a good deal more good-natured,
than he really was. She knew that a man of
any cleverness at all is fond of airing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
cleverness&mdash;and, indeed, must air it&mdash;particularly
if he is a young man. For this reason,
she made it a rule to listen generously to all
Granville had to say to her. But there was
another reason: Lady Bligh was a woman
who valued highly the confidence and companionship
of her sons. Sometimes, it is true,
she thought Granville&rsquo;s cynicism both cheap
and worthless; and sometimes (though more
rarely) she told him so. Often she thought
him absurd: she was amused, for instance,
when he solemnly assured her of the Judge&rsquo;s
high standing and fair fame in &lsquo;the Profession&rsquo;&mdash;as
if she needed <em>his</em> assurance on that
point! But it very seldom seemed to her
that the things he said were really ill-natured.
There, in the main, she was right. There
was no downright malice (as a rule) in Granville;
he was merely egotistical and vain;
he merely loved more than most things the
sound of his own voice. He did not designedly
make unkind remarks&mdash;at least, not often;
but he never took any pains to make kind
ones. He passed among men for a fellow of
good nature, and unquestionably he was
good company. Certainly Lady Bligh overestimated
his good nature; but to a great
extent she understood Granville; and in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
case&mdash;of course&mdash;she loved him. But she
loved Alfred more; and it was Alfred who
had made this marriage.</p>

<p>Yet it was only with grief that she could
think of the marriage, at present; she found
it impossible to harbour bitter feeling against
the young handsome face and honest brave
eyes that had taken poor Alfred by storm,
though they had blinded him to a hundred
blemishes. The fact is, her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s
face was haunting Lady Bligh. As the day
wore on she found herself longing wistfully
to see it again. When she did see it again,
the face was changed; its expression was
thoughtful, subdued, and even sad. Nor were
there any <i>gaucheries</i> at dinner that night,
for both Alfred and Gladys were silent and
constrained in manner.</p>

<p>Then Lady Bligh took heart afresh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It <em>is</em> only her bringing up,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;She will fall into our ways in time; indeed,
she is falling into them already&mdash;though not
in the way I wish her to; for it must not
make her sad, and it must not make her feel
ashamed. It shall not; for I mean to help
her. I mean to be to her what, indeed, I
already am without choice&mdash;her mother&mdash;if
she will only let me!&rsquo;</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">COMPARING NOTES</span></h2>


<p>But, during those first few days, Lady Bligh
did not get many opportunities of carrying
out her good intentions towards her daughter-in-law.
For several mornings in succession
Alfred carried off his wife to London, and
they never returned until late in the afternoon,
while twice during the first week the
pair went to the theatre. They were seeing
the sights of the town; and the Bride did
appear to be impressed with what she saw;
but the prospect of an unreserved and racy
commentary upon everything, which the first
hour of her installation in her husband&rsquo;s
family had seemed to hold out&mdash;and which
Granville, for one, had counted upon&mdash;was
not properly realised. And at this Alfred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
perhaps, was scarcely less disappointed than
Granville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell them more what you
think of things?&rsquo; said Alfred. &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t
fancy you half appreciate the Old Country.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; replied his young wife.
&lsquo;You know that I <em>do</em> like what I see, dear:
you know that I am just delighted with
everything: but how can I tell them so, unless
I tell them in my own way? Well, then,
I see they don&rsquo;t like it when I drag in the
Colonies; yet you must compare what you
see with something you&rsquo;ve seen before; and
the Colonies is the only other country ever
I did see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the fact is, it was not so much their
daughter-in-law&rsquo;s comparisons, which were
inoffensive in themselves, as the terms in
which these comparisons were expressed, that
Lady Bligh and Sir James felt bound to discourage.
For it soon became plain that
Gladys could not talk for two minutes about
her native country without unseemly excitement;
and this excitement was invariably
accompanied by a small broadside of undesirable
phrases, and by an aggravation of
the dreadful Australian twang, even if
some quite indecorous Bush idiom did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
necessitate a hasty change of subject. When
Australia was rigorously tabooed the Bride
was safe, and stupid; when it was not, she
might be bright and animated and amusing&mdash;but
you could never tell what she would say
next&mdash;the conversation was full of perils and
pitfalls.</p>

<p>The particular conversations that revealed
the thinness of the ice in this quarter were
trivial in the extreme. In them it was mere
touch-and-go with the dangerous subject,
nothing more: nothing more because Gladys
was quick to perceive that the subject was
unpopular. So she became rather silent in
the long evenings at the dinner-table and in
the drawing-room; for it was her only subject,
this one that they did not seem to like.
To strangers, however, who were glad to get up
a conversation with one of the prettiest women
they had ever met in their lives, this seemed
the likeliest topic in the world; <em>they</em> could not
know that Australia was dangerous ground.
The first of them who ventured upon it did
not soon forget the experience; it was probably
always a more amusing reminiscence
to him than to Gladys&rsquo;s new relatives, who
heard all that passed, and grinned and bore
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
The stranger in question was by way of
being illustrious. He was a Midland magnate,
and his name, Travers, was a good one; but,
what was for the moment much more to the
point, he was a very newly elected Member
of the House of Commons; in fact, &lsquo;the new
boy&rsquo; there. He came down to dinner at
Twickenham flushed with the agreeable heat
of successful battle. Only the week before
he had snatched his native borough from the
spreading fire of Democracy, and won one of
the very closest and most keenly contested
by-elections of that year. Naturally enough,
being a friend of some standing, he talked
freely of his electioneering experiences, and
with a victor&rsquo;s rightful relish. His manner,
it must be owned, was a trifle ponderous;
according to Granville, he was an inflated
bore. But Mr Travers, M.P., was sufficiently
well listened to (Lady Bligh was such a
wonderful listener); and he fought his good
fight over and over again with such untiring
energy, and depicted it from so many commanding
points of view, that, even when it
came to tea in the drawing-room, the subject
was still unfinished. At all events, it then
for the first time became lively; for it was
then that Mr Travers turned to young Mrs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
Bligh (also for the first time), and honoured
her with an observation:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No doubt you order these things better
in Australia; eh?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What things?&rsquo; asked the Bride, with
some eagerness; for of Australia she had been
thinking, but not of Mr Travers or his election.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the Member, with dignity,
&lsquo;your elections. I was speaking of the difficulty
of getting some of the lower orders to
the poll; you have almost to drive them
there. What I say is, that very probably, in
Australia, you manage these things on a
superior system.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We do,&rsquo; said the Bride laconically.</p>

<p>The new Member looked astonished; he
had expected a more modest answer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; he said stiffly, and addressed
himself to his tea-cup.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For,&rsquo; explained the Bride, exhibiting
dangerous symptoms, &lsquo;we <em>do</em> drive &rsquo;em to
the poll out there, and make no bones about
it either!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; said Mr Travers again; but
this time there was some curiosity in his
tone. &lsquo;This is interesting. I always thought
Australia was such a superlatively <em>free</em>
country!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
The Bride scented a sarcasm.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; she cried warmly, beginning to
speak at a perilous pace, and with her worst
twang; &lsquo;<em>my</em> word it is! But you don&rsquo;t understand
me. It&rsquo;s like this: we <em>do</em> drive &rsquo;em to
the poll, up the Bush; I&rsquo;ve driven &rsquo;em lots o&rsquo;
times myself. They&rsquo;re camped out&mdash;the
voters, like&mdash;all over the runs, for all the
hands have a vote; and to get &rsquo;em to the
police-barracks (the poll, d&rsquo;ye see?) on election
day, each squatter&rsquo;s got to muster his
own men and drive &rsquo;em in. I used to take
one trap with four horses, and father another.
Gracious, what a bit of fun it was! But the
difficulty was&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, for Lady Bligh was staring
at her; and, though her ladyship&rsquo;s face was
in shadow, the Bride was disturbed, for a
moment, by the rigid pose of the old lady&rsquo;s
head. A queer expression was come over
the face of the new Member, moreover; but
this Gladys could not see, for he was a tall
man, standing, while she was seated.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What <em>was</em> the difficulty?&rsquo; asked Granville
from a corner, in an encouraging tone.</p>

<p>Gladys instantly forgot Lady Bligh. &lsquo;To
keep &rsquo;em from going to the shanty <em>first</em>,&rsquo; she
answered, with a merry laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
&lsquo;The shanty?&rsquo; repeated Mr Travers, with
a vague idea of sailors&rsquo; songs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The pub., then. Of course they all went
afterwards, and&mdash;but we were obliged to
keep them sober till they&rsquo;d voted; and
that&rsquo;s where the difficulty came in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The assembly shuddered; but, before new
ground could be broken, Mr Travers, for
the first time interested in somebody else&rsquo;s
electioneering experiences, said inquiringly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;These squatters I presume, represent the
landed interest; <em>my</em> party, in fact?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know nothing about that,&rsquo;
replied the Bride.</p>

<p>At this juncture Alfred announced, in an
uncommonly loud and aggressive tone, that&mdash;what
do you think?&mdash;the glass was going
down!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; cried Sir James, with a lively concern
quite foreign to his habit. &lsquo;Dear, dear!
And Mr Travers just now assured me that
the weather was quite settled. I fear that
this will disappoint&mdash;er&mdash;Mr Travers!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But it failed even to attract that gentleman&rsquo;s
attention; and Granville, in the background,
chuckled satanically over the ingenuousness
of the device. Mr Travers, in fact,
was sufficiently interested elsewhere. &lsquo;Yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
of course,&rsquo; he was saying, &lsquo;there <em>are</em> two
parties?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>My</em> word, there are!&rsquo; returned the Bride.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And do you call them Whig and Tory?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;&mdash;doubtfully.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Conservative and Liberal, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not that I know of.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yet you say you have two parties&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course we have, same as you,&rsquo; broke
in the Bride, who would brook anything
rather than the implied inferiority of Australia
in the most trivial respect. &lsquo;But all
ever <em>I</em> heard &rsquo;em called was the squatters&rsquo;
candidate and the selectors&rsquo; <em>man</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And your men, I suppose, voted for the
squatters&rsquo; candidate?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should rather hope so!&rsquo; said Mrs
Alfred, with severe emphasis. &lsquo;Even Daft
Larry&mdash;who&rsquo;s both deaf and mad&mdash;had sense
enough to give us his vote!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr Travers, though astonished at her
tone, said nothing at the moment; but
Granville asked from his corner:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What if they didn&rsquo;t, Gladys?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Bride was seized with a sudden fit of
uncontrollable mirth. Some reminiscence
evidently tickled her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There <em>was</em> one man that we knew of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
that voted wrong,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and he got it
pretty hot, I can tell you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Advanced Australia!&rsquo; murmured Granville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to hear that, Mrs Bligh,&rsquo;
said Mr Travers (who had ceased to deal
with those local tradesmen, at his place in the
Midlands, who were suspected of having
&lsquo;voted wrong&rsquo; the previous week). &lsquo;I am
sorry indeed to hear that. May I ask who
punished him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Certainly&mdash;<em>I</em> did.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was a startling reply. The Judge quietly
quitted the room. Alfred, with his back
to every one, surveyed his red face in the
mantel-mirror, and ground his teeth; only
Lady Bligh sat stoically still.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He came back to the trap very drunk&mdash;blind,
speechless, paralytic,&rsquo; the Bride explained
rapidly, &lsquo;and owned up what he&rsquo;d
done as bold as brass. So I let him have it
with the whip, pretty sudden, I can tell
you. It was chiefly for his drunken insolence&mdash;but
not altogether,&rsquo; said Gladys, candidly.</p>

<p>Mr Travers had been glad to pick up a
thing or two concerning Australian politics,
but he seemed now to consider himself
sufficiently enlightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
&lsquo;Do you sing, Mrs Bligh?&rsquo; he asked somewhat
abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not a note,&rsquo; said the Bride, perceiving
with regret that the subject was changed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You play, perhaps? If so&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t play neither,&rsquo; said the Bride,
smiling broadly&mdash;and bewitchingly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m no
good at all, you see!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It seemed too true. She had not the
saving grace of a single accomplishment&mdash;nothing,
nothing, nothing but her looks!</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">IN RICHMOND PARK</span></h2>


<p>The day after Mr Travers dined at Twickenham
was almost the first day that passed
without the happy pair running up to London
together.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s far too hot to think of town, or of
wearing anything but flannels all day,&rsquo; said
Alfred in the morning. &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s plenty
to see hereabouts, Gladdie. There&rsquo;s Bushey
Park and Hampton Court, and Kew Gardens,
and Richmond Park. What do you say to a
stroll in Richmond Park? It&rsquo;s as near as
anything, and we shall certainly get most air
there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys answered promptly that she was
&lsquo;on&rsquo; (they were alone); and they set out
while the early haze of a sweltering day was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
hanging closely over all the land, but closest
of all about the river.</p>

<p>There was something almost touching in
the air of serious responsibility with which
these two went about their daily sight-seeing;
though Granville derived the liveliest entertainment
from the spectacle. The worst of
guides himself, and in many respects the least
well-informed of men, Alfred nevertheless had
no notion of calling in the aid of a better
qualified cicerone, and of falling into the rear
himself to listen and learn with his wife. At
the same time, the fierce importance, to his
wife, of this kind of education exaggerated
itself in his mind; so he secretly armed himself
with &lsquo;Baedeker,&rsquo; and managed to keep a
lesson ahead of his pupil, on principles well
known to all who have ever dabbled in the
noble art of &lsquo;tutoring.&rsquo; But, indeed, Alfred&rsquo;s
whole conduct towards his wife was touching&mdash;touching
in its perpetual tenderness, touching
in its unflagging consideration, and ten
times touching in the fact that his devotion
was no longer blind. His eyes had been
slowly and painfully opened during this first
week at home. Peculiar manners, which, out
there in the Bush, had not been peculiar,
seemed worse than that here in England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
They had to bear continual comparison with
the soft speech and gentle ways of Lady
Bligh, and the contrast was sharp and cruel.
But the more Alfred realised his wife&rsquo;s defects
the more he loved her. That was the nature
of his simple heart and its simple love. At
least <em>she</em> should not know that he saw her in
a different light, and at first he would have
cut his tongue out rather than tell her
plainly of her peculiarities. Presently she
would see them for herself, and then, in her
own good time, she would rub down of her own
accord the sharper angles; and then she
would take Lady Bligh for her model, instinctively,
without being told to do so: and
so all would be well. Arguing thus, Alfred
had not allowed her to say a word to him
about that escapade with the stock-whip on
the first morning, for her penitence was
grievous to him&mdash;and was it a thing in the least
likely to happen twice? Nevertheless, he was
thoroughly miserable in a week&mdash;that electioneering
conversation was the finisher&mdash;and
at last he had determined to speak. Thus
the walk to Richmond was strangely silent,
for all the time he was casting about for
some way of expressing what was in his
mind, without either wounding her feelings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
or letting her see that his own were
sore.</p>

<p>Now they walked to Richmond by the
river, and then over the bridge, but, before
they climbed the hill to the park gates, a
solemn ceremony, insisted upon by Alfred,
was duly observed: the Bride ate a &lsquo;Maid-of-Honour&rsquo;
in the Original Shop; and when
the famous delicacy had been despatched
and criticised, and Alfred had given a wild
and stumbling account of its historic origin,
his wife led the way back into the sunshine
in such high spirits that his own dejection
deepened sensibly as the burden of his unuttered
remonstrances increased. At last, in
despair, he resolved to hold his tongue, for
that morning at least. Then, indeed, they
chatted cheerfully together for the first time
during the walk, and he was partly with her
in her abuse of the narrow streets and pavements
of Richmond, but still stuck up for
them on the plea that they were quaint and
thoroughly English; whereat she laughed
him to scorn; and so they reached the
park.</p>

<p>But no sooner was the soft cool grass
under their dusty feet, and the upland swelling
before them as far as the eye could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
travel, than the Bride became suddenly and
unaccountably silent. Alfred stole curious
glances as he walked at her side, and it seemed
to him that the dark eyes roving so eagerly
over the landscape were grown wistful and sad.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How like it is to the old place!&rsquo; she exclaimed
at last.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean your father&rsquo;s run,
Gladdie?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I do; this reminds me of it more
than anything I&rsquo;ve seen yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What nonsense, my darling!&rsquo; said Alfred,
laughing. &lsquo;Why, there is no such green spot
as this in all Australia!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! you were there in the drought, you
see; you never saw the run after decent rains.
If you had, you&rsquo;d soon see the likeness between
those big paddocks in what we call
the &ldquo;C Block&rdquo; and this. But the road
spoils this place; it wants a Bush road; let&rsquo;s
get off it for a bit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they bore inward, to the left, and
Gladys was too thoroughly charmed, and too
thoughtful, to say much. And now the cool
bracken was higher than their knees, and the
sun beat upon their backs very fiercely; and
now they walked upon turf like velvet, in the
shadow of the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t get many trees like these out
there,&rsquo; said Alfred.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;not in Riverina, I know we don&rsquo;t,&rsquo;
Gladys reluctantly admitted; and soon she
added: &lsquo;Nor any water-holes like this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For they found themselves on the margin
of the largest of the Pen Ponds. There was
no wind, not a ripple could be seen upon the
whole expanse of the water. The fierce sun
was still mellowed by a thin, gauzy haze, and
the rays were diffused over the pond in a
solid gleam. The trees on the far side
showed fairly distinct outlines, filled in with
a bluish smoky gray, and entirely without
detail. The day was sufficiently sultry, even
for the Thames Valley.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; continued Gladys, speaking
slowly and thoughtfully, &lsquo;it <em>does</em> remind one
of the Bush, somehow. I have sometimes
brought a mob of sheep through the scrub to
the water, in the middle of the day, and the
water has looked just like this&mdash;like a great
big lump of quicksilver pressed into the
ground and shaved off level. That&rsquo;d be on
the hot still days, something like to-day.
We now and then did have a day like this,
you know&mdash;only, of course, a jolly sight
hotter. But we had more days with the hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
wind, hot and strong; what terrors they were
when you were driving sheep!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You were a tremendous stock-rider,
Gladdie!&rsquo; remarked her husband.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I just! Ever since I was <em>that</em>
high! And I was fond, like, of that old run&mdash;knew
every inch of it better than any man
on the place&mdash;except the old man, and perhaps
Daft Larry. Knew it, bless you! from
sunrise&mdash;you remember the sunrise out there,
dull, and red, and sudden&mdash;to sundown, when
you spotted the station pines black as ink
against the bit of pink sky, as you came
back from mustering. Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;I forget
how it goes&mdash;no, it&rsquo;s like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem1">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas merry &rsquo;mid the black-woods when we spied the station roofs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a running fire of stock-whips and a fiery run of hoofs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the hardest day was never then too hard!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it goes, I think. We used sometimes
to remember it as we rode home, dog-tired.
But it was sheep with us, not cattle,
more&rsquo;s the pity. Why, what&rsquo;s wrong, Alfred?
Have you seen a ghost?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No. But you fairly amaze me, darling.
I&rsquo;d no idea you knew any poetry. What is
it?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
&lsquo;Gordon&mdash;mean to say you&rsquo;ve never heard
of him? Adam Lindsay Gordon! You <em>must</em>
have heard of him, out there. <em>Everybody</em>
knows him in the Bush. Why, I&rsquo;ve heard
shearers, and hawkers, and swagmen spouting
him by the yard! He was our Australian
poet, and <em>you</em> never had one to beat him.
Father says so. Father says he is as good as
Shakespeare.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred made no contradiction, for a simple
reason: he had not listened to her last sentences;
he was thinking how well she hit off
the Bush, and how nicely she quoted poetry.
He was silent for some minutes. Then he said
earnestly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish, my darling, that you would sometimes
talk to my mother like that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys returned from the antipodes in a
flash. &lsquo;I shall never talk to any of your
people any more about Australia!&rsquo; And, by
her tone, she meant it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because they don&rsquo;t like it, Alfred; I see
they don&rsquo;t, though I never see it so clearly as
when it&rsquo;s all over and too late. Yet why
should they hate it so? Why should it
annoy them? I&rsquo;ve nothing else to talk
about, and I should have thought they&rsquo;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
like to hear of another country. I know <em>I</em>
liked to hear all about England from <em>you</em>,
Alfred!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Faint though it was, the reproach in her
voice cut him to the heart. Yet his moment
had come. He had decided, it is true, to say
nothing at all; but then there had been no
opening, and here was one such as might never
come again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladdie,&rsquo; he began, with great tenderness,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t be hurt, but I&rsquo;m going to tell
you what <em>may</em> have something to do with it.
You know, you are apt to get&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say
excited&mdash;but perhaps a little <em>too</em> enthusiastic,
when you talk of the Bush. Quite right&mdash;and
no wonder, <em>I</em> say&mdash;but then, here in
England, somehow, they very seldom seem to
get enthusiastic. Then, again&mdash;I think&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you
say things that are all right out
there, but sound odd in our ridiculous ears.
For we are an abominable, insular nation of
humbugs&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; began poor Alfred with a
tremendous burst of indignation, fearing that
he had said too much, and making a floundering
effort to get out of what he <em>had</em> said. But
his wife cut him short.</p>

<p>The colour had mounted to her olive
cheeks. Denseness, at all events, was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
among her failings&mdash;when she kept
calm.</p>

<p>She was sufficiently calm now. &lsquo;I see
what you mean, and I shall certainly say no
more about Australia. &ldquo;I like a man that
is well-bred!&rdquo; Do you remember how Daft
Larry used to wag his head and say that
whenever he saw you? &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one of
the low sort,&rdquo; he used to go on; and how we
did laugh! But I&rsquo;ve been thinking, Alfred,
that he couldn&rsquo;t have said the same about
me, if I&rsquo;d been a man. And&mdash;and that&rsquo;s at the
bottom of it all!&rsquo; She smiled, but her smile
was sad.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are offended, Gladys?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not a bit. Only I seem to understand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You <em>don&rsquo;t</em> understand! And that <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> at
the bottom of it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, then, it isn&rsquo;t. So stop frowning
like that this instant. I&rsquo;d no idea you
looked so well when you were fierce. I shall
make you fierce often now. Come, you stupid
boy! I shall learn in time. How do you
know I&rsquo;m not learning already? Come
away; we&rsquo;ve had enough of the water-hole,
I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She took his arm, and together they
struck across to Ham Gate. But Alfred was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
silent and moody; and the Bride knew
why.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Dear</em> old Alfred,&rsquo; she said at last, pressing
his arm with her hand; &lsquo;I <em>know</em> I shall get
on well with all your people, in time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All of them, Gladdie?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At any rate, all but Granville.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Still not Gran! I was afraid of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; I shall never care much about Gran.
I can&rsquo;t help it, really I can&rsquo;t. He is everlastingly
sneering, and he thinks himself so
much smarter than he is. Then he enjoys
it when I make a fool of myself; I see he does;
and&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t bear him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A pugnacious expression came into Alfred&rsquo;s
face, but passed over, and left it only stern.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I know his infernal manner;
but, when he sneers, it&rsquo;s only to show
what a superior sort of fellow he is; he doesn&rsquo;t
mean anything by it. The truth is, I fear
he&rsquo;s becoming a bit of a snob; but at least he&rsquo;s
a far better fellow than you think; there really
isn&rsquo;t a better fellow going. Take my word for
it, and for Heaven&rsquo;s sake avoid words with <em>him</em>;
will you promise me this much, Gladdie?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well&mdash;though I <em>have</em> once or twice
thought there&rsquo;d be a row between us, and
though I <em>do</em> think what he&rsquo;d hear from me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
would do him all the good in the world.
But I promise. And I promise, too, not to
gas about Australia, to any of them for
a whole week. So there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They walked on, almost in silence, until
Ham Common was crossed and they had
reached the middle of the delightful green.
And here&mdash;with the old-fashioned houses on
three sides of them, and the avenue of elms
behind them and the most orthodox of
village duck-ponds at their feet&mdash;Gladys
stopped short, and fairly burst into raptures.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Alfred, as soon as he could get
a word in, which was not immediately, &lsquo;you
go on as though this was the first real, genuine
English village you&rsquo;d seen; whereas nothing
could be more entirely and typically English
than Twickenham itself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, but this seems miles and miles away
from Twickenham, and all the other villages
round about that I&rsquo;ve seen. I think I would
rather live here, where it is so quiet and still,
like a Bush township. I like Twickenham;
but on one side there&rsquo;s nothing but people
going up and down in boats, and on the
other side the same thing, only coaches instead
of boats. And I hate the sound of those
coaches, with their jingle and rattle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
horn-blowing; though I shouldn&rsquo;t hate it
if I were on one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Would you so very much like to fizz
around on a coach, then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Would I <em>not</em>!&rsquo; said Gladys.</p>

<p>The first person they saw, on getting
home, was Granville, who was lounging in
the little veranda where they had taken tea
on the afternoon of their arrival, smoking
cigarettes over a book. It was the first
volume of a novel, which he was scanning
for review. He seemed disposed to be agreeable.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladys,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this book&rsquo;s about Australia;
what&rsquo;s a &ldquo;new chum,&rdquo; please? I
may as well know, as, so far, the hero&rsquo;s
one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A &ldquo;new chum,&rdquo;&rsquo; his sister-in-law answered
him readily, &lsquo;is some fellow newly out from
home, who goes up the Bush; and he&rsquo;s
generally a fool.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Granville; &lsquo;the hero of
this story answers in every particular to your
definition.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville went on with his skimming. On
a slip of paper lying handy were the skeletons
of some of the smart epigrammatic sentences
with which the book would presently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
be pulverised. Husband and wife had gone
through into the house, leaving him to his
congenial task; when the Tempter, in humorous
mood, put it into the head of his good
friend Granville to call back the Bride for
a moment&rsquo;s sport.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say&rsquo;&mdash;the young man assumed the air
of the innocent interlocutor&mdash;&lsquo;is it true that
every one out there wears a big black beard,
and a red shirt, and jack-boots and revolvers?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, it is not; who says so?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, this fellow gives me that impression.
In point of fact, it always <em>was</em> my
impression. Isn&rsquo;t it a fact, however, that most
of your legislators (I meant to ask you this
last night, but our friend the senator gave me
no chance)&mdash;that most of your legislators are
convicts?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does your book give you that impression
too?&rsquo; the Bride inquired coolly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; that&rsquo;s original, more or less.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s wrong, altogether. But, see
here, Gran: you ought to go out there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, pray?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You remember what I said a &ldquo;new chum&rdquo;
was?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; among other things a fool.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very good. You ought to go out there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
because there are the makings of such a
splendid &ldquo;new chum&rdquo; in <em>you</em>. You&rsquo;re thrown
away in England.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville dropped his book and put up his
eyeglass. But the Bride was gone. She had
already overtaken her husband, and seized
him by the arm.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Alfred,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I have done it!
I have broken my promise! I have had words
with Gran! Oh, my poor boy&mdash;I&rsquo;m beginning
to make you wish to goodness you&rsquo;d never
seen me&mdash;I feel I am!&rsquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">GRAN&rsquo;S REVENGE</span></h2>


<p>All men may be vain, but the vanity of
Granville Bligh was, so to speak, of a special
brand. In the bandying of words (which,
after all, was his profession) his vanity was
not too easily satisfied by his own performances.
This made him strong in attack,
through setting up a high standard, of the
kind; but it left his defence somewhat weak
for want of practice. His war was always
within the enemy&rsquo;s lines. He paid too much
attention to his attack. Thus, though seldom
touched by an adversary, when touched he
was wounded; and, what was likely to militate
against his professional chances, when
wounded he was generally winged. His own
skin was too thin; he had not yet learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
to take without a twinge what he gave without
a qualm: for a smart and aggressive
young man he was simply absurdly sensitive.</p>

<p>But, though weaker in defence than might
have been expected, Granville was no mean
hand at retaliation. He neither forgot nor
forgave; and he paid on old scores and new
ones with the heavy interest demanded by his
exorbitant vanity. Here again his vanity was
very fastidious. First or last, by fair means
or foul, Granville was to finish a winner.
Until he did, his vanity and he were not on
speaking terms.</p>

<p>There were occasions, of course, when he
was not in a position either to <i>riposte</i> at once
or to whet his blade and pray for the next
merry meeting. Such cases occurred sometimes
in court, when the bench would stand
no nonsense, and brusquely said as much, if
not rather more. Incredible as it may seem,
however, Granville felt his impotency hardly
less in the public streets, when he happened
to be unusually well dressed and gutter-chaff
rose to the occasion. In fact, probably the
worst half-hour he ever spent in his life was
one fine morning when unaccountable energy
actuated him to walk to Richmond, and take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
the train there, instead of getting in at Twickenham;
for, encountering a motley and
interminable string of vehicles <i>en route</i> to
Kempton Park, he ran a gauntlet of plebeian
satire during that half-hour, such as he
never entirely could forget.</p>

<p>To these abominable experiences, the
Bride&rsquo;s piece of rudeness unrefined (which she
had the bad taste to perpetrate at the very
moment when he was being rude to her, but
in a gentlemanlike way) was indeed a mere
trifle; but Granville, it will now be seen,
thought more of trifles than the ordinary
rational animal; and this one completely
altered his attitude towards Gladys.</p>

<p>If, hitherto, he had ridiculed her, delicately,
to her face, and disparaged her&mdash;with less
delicacy&mdash;behind her back, he had been
merely pursuing a species of intellectual sport,
without much malicious intent. He was not
aware that he had ever made the poor thing
uncomfortable. He had not inquired into that.
He was only aware that he had more than
once had his joke out of her, and enjoyed
it, and felt pleased with himself. But his sentiment
towards her was no longer so devoid of
animosity. She had scored off him; he had
felt it sufficiently at the moment; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
felt it much more when it had rankled a little.
And he despised and detested himself for
having been scored off, even without witnesses,
by a creature so coarse and contemptible. He
was too vain to satisfy himself with the comfortable,
elastic, and deservedly popular
principle that certain unpleasantnesses and
certain unpleasant people are &lsquo;beneath
notice.&rsquo; Nobody was beneath Granville&rsquo;s
notice; he would have punished with his own
boot the young blackguards of the gutter,
could he have been sure of catching them,
and equally sure of not being seen; and he
punished Gladys in a fashion that precluded
detection&mdash;even Gladys herself never knew
that she was under the lash.</p>

<p>On the contrary, she ceased to dislike her
brother-in-law. He was become more polite
to her than he had ever been before; more
affable and friendly in every way. Quite
suddenly, they were brother and sister together.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How well those two get on!&rsquo; Lady Bligh
would whisper to her husband, during the
solemn game of <i>bezique</i> which was an institution
of their quieter evenings; and, indeed,
the Bride and her brother-in-law had taken
to talking and laughing a good deal in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
twilight by the open window. But, sooner or
later, Granville was sure to come over to the
card-table with Gladys&rsquo;s latest story or saying,
with which he would appear to be hugely
amused: and the same he delighted to repeat
in its original vernacular, and with its original
slips of grammar, but with his own faultless
accent&mdash;which emphasised those peculiarities,
making Lady Bligh sigh sadly and Sir James
look as though he did not hear. And Alfred
was too well pleased that his wife had come
to like Granville at last, to listen to what they
were talking about; and the poor girl herself
never once suspected the unkindness; far
from it, indeed, for she liked Granville
now.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thought he would never forgive me for
giving him that bit of my mind the other
day; but you see, Alfred, it did him good;
and now I like him better than I ever thought
possible in this world. He&rsquo;s awfully good to
me. And we take an interest in the same
sort of things. Didn&rsquo;t you hear how interested
he was in Bella&rsquo;s sweetheart at lunch
to-day?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred turned away from the fresh bright
face that was raised to his. He could not
repress a frown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
&lsquo;I <em>do</em> wish you wouldn&rsquo;t call the girl Bella,&rsquo;
he said, with some irritation. &lsquo;Her name&rsquo;s
Bunn. Why don&rsquo;t you <em>call</em> her Bunn, dear?
And nobody dreams of making talk about
their maids&rsquo; affairs, let alone their maids&rsquo;
young men, at the table. It&rsquo;s not the custom&mdash;not
in England.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A week ago he would not have remonstrated
with her upon so small a matter; but
the ice had been broken that morning in
Richmond Park. And a week ago she would
very likely have told him, laughingly, to hang
his English customs; but now she looked
both pained and puzzled, as she begged him
to explain to her the harm in what she had
said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Harm?&rsquo; said Alfred, more tenderly.
&lsquo;Well, there was no real <em>harm</em> in it&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the wrong word altogether&mdash;especially as we
were by ourselves, without guests. Still, you
know, the mother doesn&rsquo;t want to hear all
about her servants&rsquo; family affairs, and what
her servants&rsquo; sweethearts are doing in Australia,
or anywhere else. All that&mdash;particularly
when you talk of the woman by her
Christian name&mdash;sounds very much&mdash;why, it
sounds almost as though you made a personal
friend of the girl, Gladdie!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
Gladys opened wide her lovely eyes. &lsquo;Why,
so I do!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So I do!&rsquo; said the Bride again. &lsquo;And
why not, pray? There, you see, you know
of no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t be friends with
her, you goose! But I won&rsquo;t speak of her
any more as Bella, if you don&rsquo;t like&mdash;except
to her face. I shall call her what I please to
her face, sir! But, indeed, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
spoken about her at all to-day, only I <em>was</em>
interested to know her young man was out
there; and Gran seemed as interested as me,
for he went on asking questions&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred was quite himself again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Any way, darling,&rsquo; he said, interrupting
her with a kiss, &lsquo;I am glad you have got over
your prejudice against Gran!&rsquo;&mdash;and he went
out, looking it; but leaving behind him less
of gladness than he carried away.</p>

<p>The conversation had taken place in the
little morning-room in the front of the house,
which faced the west; and the strong afternoon
sunshine, striking down through the
trembling tree-tops, dappled the Bride&rsquo;s face
with lights and shadows. It was not, at the
moment, a very happy face. All the reckless,
radiant, aggressive independence of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
or three weeks ago was gone out of it. The
bold, direct glance was somewhat less bold.
The dark, lustrous, lovely eyes were become
strangely wistful. Gladys was in trouble.</p>

<p>It had crept upon her by slow degrees.
Shade by shade the fatal truth had dawned
even upon her&mdash;the fatal disparity between
herself and her new relatives. This was
plainer to no one now than to the Bride herself;
and to her the disparity meant despair&mdash;it
was so wide&mdash;and it grew wider day by
day, as her realisation of it became complete.
Well, she had made friends with Granville:
but that was all. The Judge had been
distant and ceremonious from the first: he was
distant and ceremonious still. He had never
again unbent so much as at that tragic
moment when he bade her rise from her
knees in the wet stable-yard. As for Lady
Bligh, she had begun by being kind enough;
but her kindness had run to silent sadness.
She seemed full of regrets. Gladys was
as far from her as ever. And Gladys knew
the reasons for all this&mdash;some of them.
She saw, now, the most conspicuous among
her own shortcomings; and against those that
she did see (Heaven knows) she struggled
strenuously. But there were many she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
not see, yet; she felt this, vaguely; and it was
this that filled her with despair.</p>

<p>It was green grass that she gazed out
upon from the morning-room window, as the
trouble deepened in her eyes; and in Australia
she had seldom seen grass that was green.
But just then she would have given all the
meadows of England for one strip of dry saltbush
plain, with the sun dropping down
behind the far-away line of sombre, low-sized
scrub, and the sand-hills flushing in the
blood-red light, and the cool evening wind
coming up from the south. The picture was
very real to her&mdash;as real, for the moment, as
this shaven grass-plot, and the line of tall
trees that shadowed it, with their trunks
indistinguishable, in this light, against the
old brick wall. Then she sighed, and
the vision vanished&mdash;and she thought of
Alfred.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He can&rsquo;t go on loving me always, unless
I improve,&rsquo; she said dismally. &lsquo;I <em>must</em> get
more like his own people, and get on better
with them, and all that. I <em>must</em>! Yet he
doesn&rsquo;t tell me how to set to work; and it&rsquo;s
hard to find out for oneself. I am trying;
but it&rsquo;s very hard. If only somebody would
show me how! For, unless I find out, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
can&rsquo;t care about me much longer&mdash;I see it&mdash;he
can&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yet it seemed that he did.</p>

<p>If attending to the most extravagant wish
most lightly spoken counts for anything,
Alfred could certainly care for his wife still,
and did care for her very dearly indeed. And
that wish that Gladys had expressed while
walking through the village of Ham&mdash;the
desire to drive about in a coach-and-four&mdash;had
been at least lightly uttered, and had
never since crossed her mind, very possibly.
Nevertheless, one day in the second week of
June the coach-and-four turned up&mdash;spick
and span, and startling and fairylike as Cinderella&rsquo;s
famous vehicle. It was Alfred&rsquo;s
surprise; he had got the coach for the rest of
the season; and when he saw that his wife
could find no words to thank him&mdash;but could
only gaze at him in silence, with her lovely
eyes grown soft and melting, and his hand
pressed in hers&mdash;then, most likely, the honest
fellow experienced a purer joy than he had
ever known in all his life before. Nor did
the surprise end there. By collusion with
Lady Bligh and Granville, a strong party had
been secretly convened for Ascot the very
next day; and a charming dress, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
Gladys had never ordered, came down from her
dressmaker in Conduit Street that evening&mdash;when
Alfred confessed, and was hugged.
And thus, just as she was getting low and
miserable and self-conscious, Gladys was
carried off her feet and whirled without
warning into a state of immense excitement.</p>

<p>Perhaps she could not have expressed her
gratitude more eloquently than she did but
a minute before they all drove off in the
glorious June morning; when, getting her
husband to herself for one moment, she flung
her arms about his neck and whispered
tenderly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to be as good as gold all day&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the least I can do, darling!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And she was no worse than her word.
The racing interested her vastly&mdash;she won
a couple of sweepstakes too, by the way&mdash;yet
all day she curbed her wild excitement
with complete success. Only her dark eyes
sparkled so that people declared they had
never seen a woman so handsome, and in
appearance so animated, who proved to have
so little&mdash;so appallingly little&mdash;to say for
herself. And it was Gladys herself who drove
them all home again, handling the ribbons as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
no other woman handled them that season,
and cracking her whip as very few men
could crack one, so that it was heard for half
a mile through the clear evening air, while for
half that distance people twisted their necks
and strained their eyes to see the last of the
dark, bewitching, dashing driver who threaded
her way with such nerve and skill through
the moving maze of wheels and horseflesh
that choked the country roads.</p>

<p>And, with it all, she kept her promise to
the letter. And her husband was no less
delighted than proud. And only her brother-in-law
felt aggrieved.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s too good to last,&rsquo; was that young
man&rsquo;s constant consolation. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a record,
so far; but she&rsquo;ll break out before the day is
over; she&rsquo;ll entertain us yet&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll know
the reason why!&rsquo; he may have added in his
most secret soul. At all events, as he sat
next her at dinner, when the Lady Lettice
Dunlop&mdash;his right-hand neighbour&mdash;remarked
in a whisper the Bride&rsquo;s silence, Granville
was particularly prompt to whisper back:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Try her about Australia. Sound her on
the comparative merits of their races out
there and Ascot. Talk in front of me, if you
like; I don&rsquo;t mind; and she&rsquo;ll like it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
So Lady Lettice Dunlop leant over gracefully,
and said she had heard of a race called
the Melbourne Cup; and how did it compare
with the Gold Cup at Ascot?</p>

<p>The Bride shook her head conclusively,
and a quick light came into her eyes. &lsquo;There
is <em>no</em> comparison.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mean, of course, that your race
does not compare with ours? Well, it hardly
would, you know!&rsquo; Lady Lettice smiled
compassionately.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not a bit of it!&rsquo; was the brusque and
astonishing retort. &lsquo;I mean that the Melbourne
Cup knocks spots&mdash;I mean to say, is
ten thousand times better than what we saw
to-day!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Lady Lettice sat upright again and
manipulated her fan. And it was Granville&rsquo;s
opening.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can quite believe it,&rsquo; chimed in Gran.
&lsquo;I always <em>did</em> hear that that race of yours
was the race of the world. Englishmen say
so who have been out there, Lady Lettice.
But you should tell us wherein the superiority
lies, Gladys.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Bride complied with alacrity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, the course is ever so much nicer;
there are ever so many more people, but ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
so much less crowding; the management of
everything is ever so much better; and the
dresses are gayer&mdash;<em>ever</em> so much!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ever so much&rsquo; was a recent reform suggested
by Alfred. It was an undoubted
improvement upon &lsquo;a jolly sight,&rsquo; which it
replaced; but, like most reforms, it was apt
to be too much <i>en evidence</i> just at first.</p>

<p>She rattled off the points at a reckless rate,
and paused fairly breathless. Her speaking
looks and silent tongue no longer presented
their curious contradiction; she not only
looked excited, but spoke excitedly now.
Lady Lettice smiled faintly, with elevated
eyes and eyebrows, as she listened&mdash;till the
comparison between Colonial and English
dress, at which home-touch Lady Lettice was
momentarily overcome behind her fan. But
the Bride had other hearers besides Lady
Lettice; and those who heard listened for
more; and those who listened for more heard
Granville remark pleasantly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You used to come down from the Bush
for the Melbourne Cup, then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did once,&rsquo; Gladys was heard to reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have a good time?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did <em>so</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Old gentleman in luck, then?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
&lsquo;Pretty well. No; not altogether, I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t care about going again, eh?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; but that was because he knocked
up when we got back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The conversation had become entirely
confidential between the two. Lady Lettice
was out of it, and looked as though she were
glad of that, though in reality she was listening
with quite a fierce interest. Others were
listening too, and not a few were watching
the Bride with a thorough fascination: the
good humour and high spirits with which
she was now brimming over enhanced her
beauty to a remarkable degree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What was it that knocked him up?&rsquo; inquired
Granville softly, but in distinct tones.</p>

<p>She smiled at him. &lsquo;Never you mind!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I am interested.&rsquo; He looked it.</p>

<p>She smiled at him again, not dreaming
that any other eye was upon her; then she
raised her champagne glass two inches from
the table and set it down again; and her
smile broadened, as though it were the best
joke in the world.</p>

<p>The refined tale was told. The action
was understood by all who had listened to
what went before.</p>

<p>The Judge was one of those who both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
saw and heard; and he spoke to Granville on
the subject afterwards, and with some
severity. But Gran&rsquo;s defence was convincing
enough.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Upon my honour, sir,&rsquo; he protested, &lsquo;I
had no kind of idea what was coming.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Judge, grimly, &lsquo;I hope
<em>everybody</em> did not take it in. Her own father,
too! Apart from the offensiveness of the
revelation, there was a filial disrespect in it
which, to me, was the worst part of it all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville looked at his father humorously
through his eyeglass.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I fear, sir, she is like <em>our</em> noble Profession&mdash;no
Respecter of Persons!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Judge saw nothing to smile at.
&lsquo;It is nothing to joke about, my boy,&rsquo; he
observed. &lsquo;It has provoked me more than
I can say. It is enough to frighten one out
of asking people to the house. It forces me
to do what I am very unwilling to do: I shall
speak seriously to Alfred before we go to bed.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">E TENEBRIS LUX</span></h2>


<p>Wild weather set in after Ascot. The break-up
was sudden; in England it generally is.
In a single night the wind flew into the east,
and clouds swept into the sky, and thermometers
and barometers went down with a run
together. One went to bed on a warm, still,
oppressive night in June; one got up four
months later, in the rough October weather.
The Bride came down shivering and aggrieved;
the whims and frailties of the English
climate were new to her, and sufficiently disagreeable.
She happened to be down before
any one else, moreover; and there were no fires
in the rooms, which were filled with a cheerless,
pallid light; while outside the prospect
was dismal indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
The rain beat violently upon the windows
facing the river, and the blurred panes distorted
a picture that was already melancholy
enough. The sodden leaves, darkened and
discoloured by the rain, swung heavily and
nervelessly in the wind; the strip of river
behind the trees was leaden, like the sky, and
separable from it only by the narrow, formless
smear that marked the Surrey shore.
In the garden, the paths were flanked with
yellow, turbid runnels; the lawn alone looked
happy and healthy; the life seemed drowned
out of everything else&mdash;in this single night
after Ascot. Gladys shivered afresh, and
turned her back on the windows in miserable
spirits. And, indeed, in downright
depressing spectacles, a hopeless summer&rsquo;s
day in the Thames Valley is exceptionally
rich.</p>

<p>The Bride, however, had no monopoly of
bad spirits that morning. This became plain
at breakfast, but it was not so plain that the
dejection of the others arose from the same
simple cause as her own. Vaguely, she felt
that it did not. At once she asked herself
if aught that she had done or said unwittingly
could be connected in any way with
the general silence and queer looks; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
then she questioned herself closely on every
incident of the previous day and her own
conduct therein&mdash;a style of self-examination
to which Gladys was becoming sadly used.
But no, she could remember nothing that
she had done or said amiss yesterday. With
respect to that day, at least, her conscience
was clear. She could say the same of no
other day, perhaps; but yesterday morning
she had promised her husband golden behaviour;
and she honestly believed, this morning,
that she had kept her promise well.
Yet <em>his</em> manner was strangest of all this
morning, and particularly strange towards her,
his wife. It was as though he had heard
something against her. He barely looked
at her. He only spoke to her to tell her that
he must go up to town on business, and therefore
alone; and he left without any tenderness
in bidding her good-bye, though it was the
first time he had gone up without her.</p>

<p>Gladys was distressed and apprehensive.
What had she done? She did not know;
nor could she guess. But she did know that
the longer she stood in the empty rooms, and
drummed with her fingers upon the cold,
bleared panes, gazing out at the wretched day,
the more she yearned for one little glimpse of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
the sunlit bush. The barest sand-hill on her
father&rsquo;s run would have satisfied her so long
as its contour came with a sharp edge against
the glorious dark-blue sky; the worst bit of
mallee scrub in all Riverina&mdash;with the fierce
sun gilding the leaves&mdash;would have presented
a more cheery prospect than this one on
the banks of the renowned (but overrated)
Thames. So thought Gladys; and her morning
passed without aim or occupation, but with
many sad reflections and bewildering conjectures,
and in complete solitude; for Lady
Bligh was upstairs in her little room, and
everybody else was in town. Nor did luncheon
enliven matters in the least. It was virtually
a silent, as it was certainly a disagreeable,
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>And yet, though Lady Bligh went up
again to her little room without so much as
inquiring into her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s plans for
the afternoon, neither was she without a
slight twinge of shame herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I could not help it!&rsquo; Lady Bligh
exclaimed to herself more than once&mdash;so often,
in fact, as to prove conclusively that she <em>could</em>
have helped it. &lsquo;I could not help it&mdash;indeed
I could not. Once or twice I did try to say
something&mdash;but there, I could not do it!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
After all, what have I to talk to her about?
What is there in common between us? On
the other hand, is not talking to her hanging
oneself on tenter-hooks, for dread of what
she will say next? And this is Alfred&rsquo;s
wife! No pretensions&mdash;none of the instincts&mdash;no,
not one!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A comfortable fire was burning in the
sanctum, lighting up the burnished brass of
fender and guard and the brown tiles of the
fireplace with a cheerful effect; and this
made the chill gray light that hung over the
writing-table under the window less inviting,
if possible, than it had been before luncheon.
Lady Bligh immediately felt that, for this
afternoon, writing letters over there in the
cold was out of the question. She stood
for a moment before the pleasant fire, gazing
regretfully at Alfred&rsquo;s photograph on the
chimney-piece. Then a thought smote her&mdash;heavily.
She rang the bell. A maid answered
it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Light a fire for Mrs Alfred downstairs&mdash;in
the morning-room, I think&mdash;and this
minute. How dreadful of me not to think of
it before!&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, when the servant
was gone. &lsquo;Poor girl! Now I think of it,
she <em>did</em> look cold at the table. I feel the cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
myself to-day, but she must feel it ten times
more, coming from that hot country. And I
have had a fire all the morning, and she has
not! She looked sad, too, as well as cold,
now I think of it. I wonder why? She
seems so unconscious of everything, so independent,
so indifferent. And, certainly,
I blame myself for seeing so little of her.
But does the smallest advance ever come
from <em>her</em> side? Does <em>she</em> ever try to meet
<em>me</em> half-way? If only she had done so&mdash;if
only she were to do so now&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh stopped before following further
a futile and mortifying train of speculation.
No; it were better, after all, that no advances
should be made now. It was a little too
late for them. If, in the beginning, her
daughter-in-law had come to her and sought
her sympathy and her advice, it would have
been possible then to influence and to help
her; it might have been not difficult, even, to
break to her&mdash;gently and with tact&mdash;many of
her painful peculiarities as they appeared.
But she had not come, and now it was too
late. The account might have been settled
item by item; but the sum was too heavy
to deal with in the lump.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yet her face troubles me,&rsquo; said Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
Bligh. &lsquo;It is so handsome, so striking, so full
of character and of splendid possibilities; and
I cannot understand why it should sometimes
look so wistful and longing; for at all events
this must be a very different&mdash;and surely
a preferable&mdash;existence to her old rough life
out there, with her terrible father&rsquo; (Lady
Bligh shuddered), &lsquo;and no mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She could not write, so she drew the easy-chair
close to the fire, and wrapped a shawl
about her shoulders, and placed a footstool
for her feet, and sat down in luxury with a
Review. But neither could Lady Bligh read,
and ultimately her brooding would probably
have ended in a nap, had not some one tapped
at the door.</p>

<p>Lady Bligh&mdash;a hater of indolence, who
commonly practised her principle&mdash;being
taken unawares, was weak enough to push
back her chair somewhat, and to kick aside
the footstool, before saying, &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo; Then
she looked round&mdash;and it was the Bride
herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Am I disturbing you very much?&rsquo; asked
Gladys, calmly; indeed, she shut the door
behind her without waiting for the
answer.</p>

<p>Lady Bligh was taken aback rather; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
she did not show it. &lsquo;Not at all. Pray come
in. Is it something you want to ask me
about?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s lots of things I want to ask you
about; if it isn&rsquo;t really bothering you too
much altogether, Lady Bligh.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course it is not, child; I should say
so if it were,&rsquo; Lady Bligh answered, with
some asperity. But her manner was not
altogether discouraging.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you. Then I think I will sit down
on that footstool by the fender&mdash;it is so
cold. May I? Thanks. There, that won&rsquo;t
keep the fire from you at all. Now, first of
all, may I do <em>all</em> the questioning, Lady Bligh,
please?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh stared.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What I mean is, may I ask you questions
without you asking me any? You needn&rsquo;t
answer if you don&rsquo;t like, you know. You
may even get in a&mdash;in a rage with me, and
order me out of the room, if you like. But
please let me do the questioning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not likely to get in a rage with you,&rsquo;
said Lady Bligh, dryly, &lsquo;though I have no idea
what is coming; so you had better begin,
perhaps.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well; then what I want to know is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
this&mdash;and I do want to know it very badly
indeed. When you married, Lady Bligh,
were you <em>beneath</em> Sir James?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh sat bolt upright in her chair,
and stared severely at her daughter-in-law.
Gladys was sitting on the low stool with her
hands clasped about her knees, and leaning
backward with half her weight thus thrown
upon her long straight arms. And she was
gazing, not at the fire nor at Lady Bligh, but
straight ahead at the wall in front of her.
Her fine profile was stamped out sharply
against the fire, yet touched at the edge with
the glowing light, which produced a kind of
Rembrandt effect. There was no movement
of the long eyelashes projecting from the profile;
the well-cut lips were firm. So far as
could be seen from this silhouette, the Bride
was in earnest. Lady Bligh checked the
exclamation that had risen to her lips, and
answered slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not understand you, Gladys.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No?&rsquo; Gladys slowly turned her face
to that of her companion; her eyes now
seemed like still black pools in a place of
shadows; and round her head the red firelight
struggled through the loopholes and
outworks of her hair. &lsquo;Well, I mean&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
it considered a very great match for
<em>you</em>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; it certainly was not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then he was not much above you&mdash;in
riches or rank or anything else?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; we were both very poor; our early
days were a struggle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you were equals from the very
beginning&mdash;not only in money?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; socially we were equals too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys turned her face to the fire, and
kept it so turned. &lsquo;I am rather sorry,&rsquo; she said
at length, and sighed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are sorry? Indeed!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, Lady Bligh, and disappointed too;
for I&rsquo;d been hoping to find you&rsquo;d been ever so
much beneath Sir James. Don&rsquo;t you see, if
you <em>had</em> been ever so much beneath him, you
aren&rsquo;t a bit now; and it would have proved
that the wife can become what the husband
is, if she isn&rsquo;t that to begin with&mdash;and if she
tries hard. No&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t interrupt unless
it&rsquo;s to send me away. I want you to suppose
a case. Look back, and imagine that your
own case was the opposite to what it really
was. That Sir James was of a very good
family. That you were not only not that,
but were stupid and ignorant, and a worse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
thing&mdash;vulgar. That you had lived your
rough life in another country; so that when
he brought you to England as his wife, your
head was full of nothing but that other
country, which nobody wanted to know anything
about. That you couldn&rsquo;t even talk
like other people, but gave offence, not only
without meaning to, but without knowing
how. That&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh could hear no more. &lsquo;Oh,
Gladys!&rsquo; she exclaimed in a voice of pain,
&lsquo;you are not thinking of yourself?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a question! Still, as it&rsquo;s your
first, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you you&rsquo;ve hit it,
Lady Bligh. I <em>am</em> thinking of myself. But
you must let me finish. Suppose&mdash;to make
short work of it&mdash;that you had been me,
what would you have done to get different,
like?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My poor child! I cannot bear to hear you
talk like this!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Lady Bligh. I want you to
tell me how you&rsquo;d have gone about it&mdash;you
know what I mean.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, Gladys; I can&rsquo;t
indeed!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What! Can&rsquo;t tell me what you would have
done&mdash;what I ought to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
&lsquo;I cannot!&rsquo; Lady Bligh commanded her
voice with difficulty. &lsquo;I cannot!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! then it&rsquo;s no good saying anything
more about that.&rsquo; There was a touch of
bitterness in the girl&rsquo;s tone. &lsquo;But, at any
rate, you might give me a hint or two how
to be more like what you <em>are</em>. Can&rsquo;t you do
that, even?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, my dear&mdash;how can I? I am no
model, Heaven knows!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you? Then I will get up. I am
going, Lady Bligh. It&rsquo;s no good staying and
bothering you any longer. I have asked my
questions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She rose sadly from the stool, and her
eyes met Lady Bligh&rsquo;s again. For some
minutes she had kept her face turned steadily
to the fire. The rich warm glow of the fire
still flushed her face and lingered in her
luminous eyes. In the half-lit room, with the
rain rattling ceaselessly against the panes, the
presence of the Bride was especially attractive
and comforting; but perhaps it was
chiefly the rarity of her companionship to
Lady Bligh that made the latter clutch Gladys&rsquo;s
hand so eagerly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go, my dear. Stop, and let us
talk. This is practically our first talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
together, Gladys, dear; you needn&rsquo;t be in such
a hurry to end it. Sit down again. And&mdash;and
I do wish you would not always call me
&ldquo;Lady Bligh&rdquo;!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then what am I to call you, pray?&rsquo;
Gladys smiled up into the old lady&rsquo;s face;
she could not help facing her now, for Lady
Bligh would hold her hand; she was even
forced to draw the footstool closer to the
easy-chair; and thus she was now sitting at
Lady Bligh&rsquo;s feet, touching her, and holding
her hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Could you not&mdash;sometimes&mdash;call me&mdash;&ldquo;mother&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys laughed. &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because you could never be a mother to
<em>me</em>. You might to another daughter-in-law,
but not to me. You, who are so gentle and
graceful and&mdash;and <em>everything</em>, could never
seem like a mother to a&mdash;well, to me. People
would say so, too, if they heard me call you
&ldquo;mother.&rdquo; It would make everybody
laugh.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladys! Gladys! How cruel you are to
yourself! You are not what you say you are.
Here&mdash;just now&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the Bride, sadly. &lsquo;Here! Just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
now! Yes, it is easy enough here and now.
Here in the quiet, by the fireside, alone with
you, it is easy enough to be well-behaved. I
am on my good behaviour, and no one
knows it better than I do. And I know it, too,
when I behave badly; but not till afterwards.
I go forgetting myself, you see. I believe it&rsquo;s
principally when they talk to me about Australia.
I suppose I lose my head, and talk
wildly, and less like a lady than usual even.
Alfred has told me, you see; though I don&rsquo;t
know where it was I went wrong yesterday.
I thought I was so very good all day. I hardly
opened my mouth to anybody. But somehow
I can&rsquo;t help it when the Bush crops up. You
see, I&rsquo;m a Bush girl. <em>All</em> the girls out there
aren&rsquo;t like me; don&rsquo;t you believe it. They
would think me as bad as you do. I&rsquo;m not a
sample, you see. I should be riled if I was
taken for one; nothing riles me so much as
people speaking or thinking meanly of Australia!
But here, alone with you, with everything
so quiet, it would be difficult not to
be quiet too. What&rsquo;s more, I like it, Lady
Bligh&mdash;I do indeed. I can&rsquo;t come lady-like
all at once, perhaps; but if I was oftener
beside you, like just now, I might by degrees
get more like you, Lady Bligh.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
&lsquo;Then you shall be oftener with me&mdash;you
shall, my dear!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you&mdash;thank you so much! And
I shan&rsquo;t mind if you send me away; yet I
won&rsquo;t speak if you&rsquo;re busy. If you&rsquo;ll only let
me come in sometimes, for a little bit, that&rsquo;s
all I ask.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You shall come in as often as ever you like,
my darling!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old lady had drawn her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s
head backward upon her lap, and was
caressing the lovely hair, more and more nervously,
and bending over the upturned face.
Gladys leant back with half-closed eyes.
Suddenly a scalding drop fell upon her cheek.
Next moment the girl was upon her feet. The
moment after that she had fallen upon her
knees and caught Lady Bligh&rsquo;s hands in her
own.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are crying!&rsquo; said Gladys, hoarsely.
&lsquo;You are crying, and because of me! Oh,
Lady Bligh, forgive me! How could I know
I should bring you such trouble as this? I
never knew&mdash;I never dreamt it would be like
this. Alfred told me that I should get on
well with you all. He was blind, poor boy,
but <em>I</em> might have known; only we loved each
other so! Oh, forgive me&mdash;forgive me for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
marrying him! Say that you forgive me!
Before God, I never thought it would be like
this!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My daughter! I have nothing to forgive!
Kiss me, Gladys&mdash;kiss me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I will kiss you; but I have brought
misery upon you all; and I will never forgive
myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladys&mdash;you have <em>not</em>! Do not think
it&mdash;and don&rsquo;t go, Gladys.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must go. You have been good and
kind to me; but this is hard for me too,
though I am not crying. I never cry, though
sometimes I feel inclined to, when I think of
everything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But now you will often come beside me,
Gladys?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I will come. And I will try to change;
you have helped me already. It will not come
all at once; but perhaps I can prevent myself
giving you any fresh cause to be downright
ashamed of me. Nay, I must. That&rsquo;s
the least I can do. If I fail&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She stopped, as though to think well of
what she was saying. Her face became pale
and stern&mdash;Lady Bligh never forgot it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I fail,&rsquo; she repeated slowly, &lsquo;after this,
you will know that I am hopeless!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
She went to the door, but turned on the
threshold, as though wishful to carry away
a distinct impression of the scene&mdash;the half-lit
room, the failing fire still reflected in the
burnished brasses, the darkening panes still
beaten by the wild rain, and the figure of
Lady Bligh, dimly outlined and quivering
with gentle weeping. Then she was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">PLAIN SAILING</span></h2>


<p>Among unexpected pleasures there are few
greater than the sudden discovery that one
has become the living illustration of a common
proverb. Of course the proverb must be of
the encouraging order; but then most proverbs
are. Equally of course, the conditions
of this personal illustration should be exceptionally
delightful; yet will there still remain
an intrinsic charm in your relations with the
proverb. You will feel benignantly disposed
towards it for evermore. You will receive it
henceforth with courtesy, even in the tritest
application. Nor need the burden of obligation
be all on your side: you can give that
proverb a good character among your friends&mdash;a
thing that few people will do for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
proverb. You can tell it frankly: &lsquo;Sir, I
always thought you were a humbug, like the
rest of them. Now I know better. I admit
that I was hasty. I apologise. I shall speak
up for <em>you</em>, sir, till my dying day!&rsquo;</p>

<p>That good-hearted fellow, Alfred Bligh,
awaking gradually to a sensation of this sort,
became very rapidly the happiest of men.
The proverb in his case was the one about
the dawn and the darkest hour. Alfred&rsquo;s
darkest hour had been the day after Ascot,
when, after a perfectly amicable conversation
with the Judge, he had rushed up to town
with ice at his heart and schemes of instant
removal in his head. His dawn was the same
evening, at dinner, when an indefinable <i>je ne
sais quoi</i> in the mutual manner of Gladys and
his mother attracted his attention and held
him in suspense. And after dinner his sun
rose quickly up.</p>

<p>The happiness of the succeeding days&mdash;to
Alfred, to Gladys, and to Lady Bligh&mdash;was
complete and pure. Nothing much happened
in those last perfect days of June, when the
rain had all fallen, and the wind changed,
and summer was come back. There was
some rowing on the sunlit river, and a good
deal of coaching, in small parties; but on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
whole they were quiet days. Yet these were
the days that stood out most plainly through
the dim distance of after years.</p>

<p>To be closely intimate with Lady Bligh
meant an intimacy with a nature that was
generous and sweet and womanly; and it
included a liberal education&mdash;for those who
would help themselves to it&mdash;in gentle, unaffected
manners. Gladys came under this
very desirable influence at a favourable
moment, and in precisely the right frame of
mind to profit most by it. And profit she did.
As she herself had predicted, no miracle was
wrought; she did not become everything that
she ought to have been in a day; but several
small alterations of manner, all of them for
the better, did very quickly take place.</p>

<p>The Bride felt her feet at last. Then,
becoming thoroughly in touch with Lady
Bligh, she waxed bold in a less approachable
direction, and with the best results. Not
only did she start lively little conversations
with Sir James, but she got him to carry
them on in the same light strain, and sustained
her part in them very creditably indeed,
all things considered. But the subject
of his judicial functions was now avoided
far more sedulously by Gladys than by the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
gentleman himself. She even joined the Judge
more than once in his early morning prowls;
but the stock-whip was always left behind in
her room. On these occasions she showed
herself to be an admirable assistant-potterer;
while she delighted her old companion still
further by many pretty and even delicate
attentions, to which he was not used, having
no daughters of his own. Thus there were
mornings when the Judge would come in
to breakfast with quite a startling posy in
his button-hole, and with a certain scarcely
perceptible twitching of the lips and lowering
of the eyelids, such as had been observed in
him sometimes on the bench when the rest of
the court were &lsquo;convulsed with laughter.&rsquo;
It invariably transpired that the decoration
was the work and gift of the Judge&rsquo;s daughter-in-law;
and, as the old gentleman had never
before been seen by his family to sport any
such ornament, the departure was extremely
gratifying to most of them.</p>

<p>Granville, it is true, found fault with the
taste displayed in the composition of the
button-holes, and one morning flatly refused
one that had been made for him expressly;
but the fact is, Granville was of rather small
account in the house just now. He was busy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
certainly, and was seen very little down at
Twickenham; but he might have been seen
more&mdash;his temporary occupation of a back-seat
was in a great measure voluntary. Nor
was he really malicious at this time. It is
true that he spoke of the leopard&rsquo;s spots, and
used other phrases equally ominous but less
hackneyed; for the most part, however, he
made these observations to himself. He
could have found nowhere a more appreciative
and sympathetic audience. But, though
he looked on sardonically enough at the
Bride&rsquo;s conquests, Granville did not lay himself
out to hinder them. This should be
clearly understood. The fellow was not a
full-blown Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>And the happy pair were indeed happy.
But for an occasional wistful, far-away look&mdash;such
as will come sometimes to every exile,
for all the &lsquo;pleasures and palaces&rsquo; of new
worlds&mdash;Gladys seemed to everybody to be
gay and contented as the midsummer days
were long. As for Alfred, he considered the
sum of his earthly happiness complete. Even
the ideal farm (which his solicitors were doing
their best to find for him) in the ideal sleepy
hollow (which <em>he</em> meant to do <em>his</em> best to
wake up, by the introduction of vigorous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
Bush methods)&mdash;when purchased, stocked,
furnished, inhabited, and in full swing&mdash;could
not, he felt, add much to his present happiness.
Poor Alfred! He was laying out the
future on idyllic lines. But, meanwhile, the
present was full of happy days; and that was
well.</p>

<p>There was one evening that Alfred did
not soon forget.</p>

<p>It was the last Sunday in June. There
had been a thunderstorm early in the afternoon
and a smart shower. The evening air
was a long, cool, delicious draught, flavoured
with the exquisite fragrance of dripping
leaves and petals; and this, and the sound of
the church bells, and the sunlight glittering
upon the wet lanes, came back to Alfred
afterwards as often as he remembered the
conversation which made the walk to the old
church all too short. Alfred walked with
his mother; Gladys, some little distance ahead,
with the Judge.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think Gladys likes England a little
better now,&rsquo; observed Lady Bligh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And can&rsquo;t England say the same thing of
Gladys?&rsquo; cried Alfred. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t answer the
question&mdash;it&rsquo;s idiotic. But oh, mother, I&rsquo;m
a fool with very joy!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
&lsquo;Because Gladys has won all our hearts,
dear?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; and I really think she has. You
have all been so good, so patient and forgiving.
Don&rsquo;t stop me, mother. If you had
been different, I know I never should have
allowed that you had anything to forgive;
but now that you are like this, I own
that there was much. Look at her now
with the Judge; he has given her his arm.
Now think of the beginning between these
two!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why think of that? We have all forgotten
it. You must forget it too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think of it,&rsquo; said Alfred, &lsquo;because it is
all over; because you have civilised my wild
darling; and because I like to realise this.
But, upon my soul, if you had seen her life
out there; if you knew her father (she doesn&rsquo;t
remember her mother); if you had any idea
of the work she did on that run; you would
simply be amazed&mdash;as I am, now that I look
back upon it&mdash;at what your tenderness has
done. But do you know, mother, what the
dear girl says? I had nearly forgotten to tell
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One would have counted upon a joke, and
possibly a good one; for Alfred stopped to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
chuckle before coming out with it; though,
certainly Alfred was not the best judge of
jokes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She says that if ever she makes you feel
regularly ashamed of her again, she may be
considered hopeless; and though you forgive
her, she&rsquo;ll never forgive herself! That&rsquo;s
rather rich, eh?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh failed to see it in that light.
On the contrary, for one moment she seemed
both surprised and pained.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps, Alfred,&rsquo; she said, thoughtfully,
&lsquo;she still feels the restraint, and hates our
conventionalities. I often think she must;
I sometimes think she does.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not she! Not a bit of it! She&rsquo;s as safe
as the Bank, and as happy as they make &rsquo;em,
<em>I</em> know her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Poor Alfred!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh again; &lsquo;but
there may be a constant effort which we cannot
see; and I have once or twice caught a
look in her eyes&mdash;but let that pass. I may
be wrong; only I think it has been rather
slow for her lately. She must have more
amusement. There are one or two amusing
things coming on presently. But just now
I should like to think of something quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
fresh to interest her. My dear boy! you are
whistling!&mdash;in the churchyard!&rsquo;</p>

<p>In fact, Alfred was foolish with joy, as he
himself had said. He could not control his
spirits long when speaking of Gladys, and
hearing her well spoken of by the others, and
marvelling at the change that a few days
had brought about. It was a case of either
laughing or crying with him then; and the
tears never got a chance.</p>

<p>But, in the solemn twilight of the church;
standing, kneeling, sitting by his wife&rsquo;s side;
sharing her book; listening with her to the
consummate language of the Common Prayer;
watching with her the round stained window
fail and fade against the eastern sky&mdash;then,
indeed, the boisterous, boyish spirits of this
singularly simple-minded man of thirty melted
into thankfulness ineffable and perfect
peace.</p>

<p>It so happened that they sang an anthem
in the old church that evening. This neither
attracted nor distracted Alfred at first. He
was a man without very much more music in
his soul than what he was able to whistle
when in high spirits. It did not strike him
that this anthem was lovelier than most
&lsquo;tunes.&rsquo; The sweet sensations that stole over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
his spirit as the singing of it proceeded certainly
were not credited to the music. To
the words he never would have attempted to
listen but for an accident.</p>

<p>To Alfred the anthem presented but one
of the many opportunities presented by the
Church Service for private reverie on the part
of worshippers. Of course his reverie was all
about the future and Gladys. And while he
mused his arm touched hers, that was the
delightful part of it. But on glancing down
to see her face again (he had actually not
looked upon it for five whole minutes) his
musing swiftly ended. Her singular expression
arrested his whole attention. And this
was the accident that made him listen to
the words of the anthem, to see if <em>they</em> could
have affected her so strangely.</p>

<p>The Bride&rsquo;s expression was one of powerful
yearning. The first sentence Alfred
managed to pick out from the words of the
anthem was: &lsquo;Oh, for the wings, for the
wings of a dove!&rsquo; piped in a boy&rsquo;s high treble.</p>

<p>The melting wistfulness in the Bride&rsquo;s
liquid eyes seemed to penetrate through that
darkening east window into far-away worlds;
and the choir-boy sang: &lsquo;Far away, far away
would I rove!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
The solo went on:</p>

<div class="cpoem2">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the wilderness build me a nest:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And remain there for ever at rest.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, with some repetition which seemed
vain to Alfred, the chorus swallowed the solo.
And to Alfred&rsquo;s mind the longing in his wife&rsquo;s
face had grown definite, acute, and almost
terrible.</p>

<p>As they knelt down after the anthem, his
eyes met those of his mother. She, too, had
seen Gladys&rsquo;s expression. Was it the expression
she had referred to on the way to church?
Was such an expression a common one with
his darling, and concealed only from him?
Was it possible that she was secretly longing
and pining for the Bush&mdash;now&mdash;when they
were all so happy?</p>

<p>Much later in the evening&mdash;long after
church&mdash;Lady Bligh made an opportunity of
speaking again alone with Alfred. &lsquo;I have
been maturing my little plans,&rsquo; she said,
smiling.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As regards Gladys?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; and I have been thinking that
really, after all, she need not be so dull during
the next few days&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred interrupted her hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
&lsquo;I also have been thinking; and, do you
know, after all, I half fancy that she <em>is</em> a bit
dull. I shall be very glad indeed if you
have thought of something to &rsquo;liven her up
a little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh regarded him shrewdly; but
she was not entirely astonished at this complete
change of opinion. She, too, had seen
Gladys&rsquo;s longing, far-away expression in
church. She, too, remembered it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, she will be less dull during the
next few days than just lately,&rsquo; said Lady
Bligh, after a slight pause. &lsquo;On Tuesday, to
begin with, there is this garden-party of ours;
a dull thing enough in itself, but the people
may amuse Gladys. On Wednesday, there is
to be the Opera for her, at last. Thursday
and Friday you must boat and drive. But
for Saturday&mdash;when the Lord Chief is coming&mdash;you
are all invited to lawn-tennis somewhere;
are you not? After this week it is
simply <i>embarras</i>; the two matches at Lord&rsquo;s,
and Henley too, one on top of the other;
then Wimbledon. Gladys must miss none
of these. But can you guess what my happy
thought is?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You seem to have so many happy
thoughts!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
&lsquo;No; but my little plan for to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have no idea. But I think Gladys
would be content to do nothing much to-morrow,
perhaps.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alfred,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, severely, &lsquo;Gladys
tells me you have never once had her in the
Park! How is that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;well, the fact is, I&rsquo;m such a duffer in
the <em>very</em> swagger part of the town,&rsquo; said poor
Alfred; &lsquo;and I never did know the run of the
parks properly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you shall drive with Gladys and
me, and learn. It is getting near the end of
the season, when every day makes a difference.
So, not to lose another day, we&rsquo;ll drive
in to-morrow. This is my happy thought!
I think Gladys will like it&mdash;though Garrod
won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mean he&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s too much for <em>his</em>
horses? I should think he&rsquo;ll give warning,&rsquo;
said Alfred, encouragingly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He may,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, with a fine
fearlessness which can be properly appraised
only by ladies who keep, or once kept, their
coachman. &lsquo;He may. I defy him!&rsquo;</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">A THUNDER-CLAP</span></h2>


<p>Fully ten days were wanting before the Eton
and Harrow cricket-match, which appears to
be pretty generally recognised as the last
&lsquo;turn&rsquo; in the great variety entertainment of
the season; there was plenty of life, and of
high life, too, in the town yet; and, what was
even more essential to a thorough enjoyment
of the Park, the afternoon, as regarded the
weather, was for once beyond all praise.
Moreover, Royalty was there for at least half
an hour; so that the circumstances attendant
upon young Mrs Bligh&rsquo;s first appearance in
the ring of fashion were in every way all that
could be desired.</p>

<p>It was an &lsquo;appearance&rsquo;; for Lady Bligh,
though in no sense a woman of fashion, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
sufficiently well known to attract attention,
which was heightened by the increasing rarity
of her appearances in the fashionable world.
Even had it been otherwise, the robust, striking
beauty of the dark young woman at her
side must have awakened interest on its own
account. It did, among those who did not
know the Blighs by sight. But with most
people the questions were: Where had Lady
Bligh discovered such a fresh and taking type
of prettiness? Was the girl a relative? Was
that Alfred Bligh sitting opposite to the
ladies, come back from Australia disfigured
by a beard? Was she his fianc&eacute;e&mdash;or were
they already married? It is intended by
no means to imply that the modest and even
homely equipage of Lady Bligh became the
cynosure of Hyde Park; but it was certainly
seen; and few saw it with unawakened
curiosity.</p>

<p>One or two persons were able to satisfy
to some extent this curiosity, and took a
delight in doing so; Lady Lettice Dunlop,
for one. The curiosity that Lady Lettice
relieved was of a languid and peculiarly well-bred
kind. A coronet adorned the barouche
in which she rode. She said rather more than
she knew, yet not quite all that she did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
know, and said it with a gentle disdain. But
Lady Lettice was stopped by a deprecatory
gesture of her mother the Countess before
she came to the end&mdash;which made her regret
having over-elaborated the beginning. The
Countess considered the story most coarse,
and regretted the almost friendly nature of the
bow with which she had just favoured poor
Lady Bligh. Yet, as the Lady Lettice was
generous enough to fancy, the Colonial creature
did seem on her very best behaviour this
afternoon. And in her fancy Lady Lettice
was nearer the mark than in her facts.</p>

<p>Another person, in an even better position
to answer questions concerning the Bride, was
Mr Travers, M.P.&mdash;now the newest M.P. but
one. He was walking under the trees with
his daughter, whom he was boring somewhat
with his political &lsquo;shop&rsquo;; for he was enough
of a new boy still to be full of his nice new
lessons. This Miss Travers, however, was no
young girl, but a woman of thirty, with a
kind, sweet, sympathetic face, and a nature
intensely independent. She was best known
for her splendid work in Whitechapel, though
how splendid that work really was no one
knew outside the slums, where her face was
her only protection&mdash;but a greater one than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
a cordon of police. But she had also a reputation
as a singer, which need not have been
confined to a few drawing-rooms in the West,
and numberless squalid halls in the East, had
she been ambitiously inclined. And this Miss
Travers was attracted and charmed by the
bold, conspicuous beauty of young Mrs
Bligh; pressed for an introduction; pressed all
the harder on hearing some plain truths about
the Bride and her Bush manners; and presently
had her way.</p>

<p>It was now six o&rsquo;clock. The crowning
period of the afternoon had commenced with
the arrival of Royalty a few minutes before
the hour. Carriages were drawn up by the
rails on either side in long, regular ranks.
The trough between presented visions of
glossy horseflesh and flashing accoutrements
and flawless japan, to say nothing of fine
looks and finer dress; visions changeful as
those of the shaken kaleidoscope; marvellous,
magical visions&mdash;no matter how much or how
little they owed to the golden glamour of the
sinking sun, visions of intrinsic wonder.</p>

<p>The Blighs&rsquo; serviceable vehicle had found
an anchorage by the inner rails in the thick
of all this, but not in the thickest. They
were, in fact, no farther than a furlong from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
the Corner, and thus in comparatively open
water. At this point the shrubs planted
between the two converging courses come to
an end, and the two roads are separated by
little more than twenty yards. A little way
farther on you can see only the bobbing heads
of the riders over in Rotten Row; but at this
point you have indeed &lsquo;the whole show&rsquo;
before you. The position had been taken up
on the Bride&rsquo;s express petition. It was the
riding that interested Gladys. She had no
eyes for the smart people in the carriages
when once she could watch with as little
trouble the hacks and their riders in Rotten
Row. The little interest she took in the
passing and re-passing of Royalty was somewhat
disappointing. But it was plain that she
was enjoying herself in her own way; and
that was everything. When the Traverses
came up, the interruption of this innocent
enjoyment was a distinct annoyance to
Gladys.</p>

<p>Alfred&mdash;to whom it was not an afternoon of
wild delight&mdash;got out of the carriage with
some alacrity; and Miss Travers, with a very
engaging freedom of manner, got in. She
button-holed the Bride (if that is not an exclusively
masculine act&mdash;as between man and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
man), and at first the Bride did not like it.
Very soon, however, Gladys was pleased to
withdraw her attention, partially, from Rotten
Row and transfer it to Miss Travers. Like
everybody else, the Bride was immensely
attracted; Miss Travers&rsquo;s manner was so
sympathetic, yet unaffected, and so amazingly
free (Gladys thought) from English
stiffness; and her face was infinitely kind and
sweet, and her voice musical and soft.</p>

<p>So Mr Travers, with one foot upon the
carriage-step, brought Lady Bligh up to date
in her politics generally, and in his own political
experiences in particular; and Alfred
made aimless patterns on the ground with his
feet; and Miss Travers questioned Gladys on
the subject upon which all strangers who
were told where she came from invariably
and instantly did question her. But Miss
Travers did this in a way of her own, and a
charming way. You would have thought it
had been the dream of her life to go to Australia;
you would have inferred that it was
her misfortune and not her fault that her
lines were cast in England instead of out there;
and yet you would not, you could not, have
suspected her of hypocrisy. She was one
of those singular people who seem actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
to prefer, in common conversation, the <i>tuum</i>
to the <i>meum</i>. Gladys was charmed. But
still she stole furtive glances across the
space dividing them from the tan; and
her answers, which would have been eager
and impetuous enough in any other circumstances,
came often slowly; she was obviously
<i>distraite</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Travers saw this, and followed the
direction of the dark, eager eyes, and thought
she understood. But suddenly there came a
quick gleam into the Bride&rsquo;s eyes which Miss
Travers did not understand. A horsewoman
was crossing their span of vision in the Row
at a brisk canter. The Bride became strangely
agitated. Her face was transfigured with
surprise and delight and incredulity. Her
lips came apart, but no breath escaped them.
Her flashing eyes followed the cantering
horsewoman, who, in figure and in colouring,
if not in feature, was just such another as
Gladys herself, and who sat her horse to
perfection. But she was cantering past; she
would not turn her head, she would not look;
a moment more and the shrubs would hide
her from Gladys&mdash;perhaps for ever.</p>

<p>Before that moment passed, Gladys stood
up in the carriage, trembling with excitement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
Careless of the place&mdash;forgetful of Lady
Bligh, of all that had passed, of the good
understanding so hardly gained&mdash;attracting
the attention of Royalty by conspicuously
turning her back upon them as they passed
for the fourth time&mdash;the Bride encircled her
lips with her two gloved palms, and uttered
a cry that few of the few hundreds who heard
it ever forgot:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Coo-ee!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>That was the startling cry as nearly as it
can be written. But no letters can convey
the sustained shrillness of the long, penetrating
note represented by the first syllable,
nor the weird, die-away wail of the second.
It is the well-known Bush call, the &lsquo;jodel&rsquo;
of the black-fellow; but it has seldom been
heard from a white throat as Gladys Bligh
let it out that afternoon in Hyde Park,
in the presence of Royalty.</p>

<p>To say that there was a sensation in the
vicinity of the Blighs&rsquo; carriage&mdash;to say that
its occupants were for the moment practically
paralysed&mdash;is to understate matters, rather.
But, before they could recover themselves,
the Bride had jumped from the carriage,
pressed through the posts, rushed across to
the opposite railings, and seized in both hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
the hand of the other dark and strapping
young woman, who had reined in her horse
at once upon the utterance of the &lsquo;<em>Coo-ee!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>And there was a nice little observation,
audible to many, which Gladys had let fall in
flying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good Lord deliver us&mdash;it&rsquo;s <em>her</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">PAST PARDON</span></h2>


<p>Patience and sweetness of disposition may not
only be driven beyond endurance; they may
be knocked outside in, knocked into their
own antitheses. And one need not go to crime
or even to sin to find offences which no
amount of abstract angelicalness could readily
forgive or ever forget. It is a sufficiently
bad offence, if not an actual iniquity, to
bring well-to-do people into public derision
through an act of flagrant thoughtlessness
and unparalleled social barbarity. But if the
people are not only well-to-do, but well and
honourably known, and relatives by your
marriage, who have been more than kind to
you, you could scarcely expect a facile pardon.
Sincerity apart, they would be more than mortal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
if they so much as pretended to forgive you
out of hand, and little less than divine if
they did not tell you at once what they
thought of you, and thereafter ignore you
until time healed their wounds.</p>

<p>Woman of infinite sweetness though she
was, Lady Bligh was mortal, not divine; and
she showed her clay by speaking very plainly
indeed, as the carriage swept out of the Park,
and by speaking no more (to Gladys) that
day. A good deal of cant is current about
people whose anger is violent (&lsquo;while it
lasts&rsquo;), but short-lived (&lsquo;he gets over it in a
moment&rsquo;); but it is difficult to believe in those
people. If there be just cause for wrath,
with or without violence, it is not in reason
that you can be in a rollicking good humour
the next minute. That is theatrical anger,
the anger of the heavy father. Lady Bligh,
with all her virtues, could nurse the genuine
passion&mdash;an infant that thrives at the breast.
Indeed, it is probable that before the end of
the silent drive to Twickenham (Alfred never
opened his clenched teeth all the way) this
thoroughly good woman positively detested
the daughter whom she had just learnt to love.
For it is a fallacy to suppose that the pepper-and-salt
emotion of love and hatred in equal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
parts is the prerogative of lovers; you will
find it oftener in the family.</p>

<p>What penitence Gladys had expressed had
been lame&mdash;crippled by an excuse. Moreover,
her tone had lacked complete contrition.
Indeed, if not actually defiant, her manner
was at least repellent. She had been spoken
to hotly; some of the heat was reflected; it
was a hot moment.</p>

<p>As for her excuse, it, of course, was ridiculous&mdash;<i>qua</i>
excuse.</p>

<p>She had seen her oldest&mdash;indeed, her only&mdash;girl
friend, Ada Barrington. Ada (Gladys
pronounced it &lsquo;Ida&rsquo;) was another squatter&rsquo;s
daughter; their fathers had been neighbours,
more or less, for many years; but Ada&rsquo;s
father owned more stations than one, was a
wealthy man&mdash;in fact, a &lsquo;woollen king.&rsquo;
Gladys had known they were in Europe, but
that was all. And she had seen Ada cantering
past, but Ada had not seen her. So she
had &lsquo;<em>coo-ee&rsquo;d</em>.&rsquo; What else was there to be
done? Gladys did not exactly ask this
question, but she implied it plainly. As it
happened, if she had not &lsquo;<em>coo-ee&rsquo;d</em>,&rsquo; she never
would have seen Ada again, to a certainty;
for the Barringtons had taken a place in
Suffolk, and were going down there the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
next day. That was all. Perhaps it was too
much.</p>

<p>Silence ensued, and outlasted the long
drive. What afterwards passed between the
young husband and wife did not, of course,
transpire. There was no further expression
of regret than the very equivocal and diluted
apology comprehended in the Bride&rsquo;s excuses;
indeed, Lady Bligh and her daughter-in-law
never spoke that night; nor did Alfred
attempt to mediate between them. As a
matter of fact, his wife had told him&mdash;with
a recklessness that cut him to the heart&mdash;that,
this time, she neither expected nor deserved,
nor so much as desired, any one&rsquo;s forgiveness;
that now she knew what she had feared before,
that she was hopeless; that&mdash;but the
rest was wild talk.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, Alfred went to
Lady Bligh with a letter, one that Gladys had
received by the early post. It was an invitation
from the Barringtons, the wording of
which was sufficiently impulsive and ill-considered.
Ada besought her darling Gladys
to go stay with them in Suffolk immediately,
on the following Saturday, and for as many days
as she could and would; and the invitation
included the darling&rsquo;s husband in a postscript.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
&lsquo;An extraordinary kind of invitation!&rsquo;
observed Lady Bligh, handing back the
letter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ignorance,&rsquo; said Alfred laconically.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you meet the people out there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only this girl&rsquo;s brother; the others had
been in Europe some time. I thought him a
very pleasant fellow, I remember, though his
contempt for me and for all &ldquo;home&rdquo; birds
was magnificent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Lady Bligh, &lsquo;it is hardly the
kind of invitation that Gladys can accept. Is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She refuses to think of it,&rsquo; Alfred answered,
with a frown that rather puzzled
Lady Bligh. &lsquo;But I hope she will change
her mind. I wish her to go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His mother was silent for more than a
minute. &lsquo;Does the letter say Saturday?&rsquo;
she then inquired.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Alfred gazed steadily in his mother&rsquo;s
face as though he would search her inmost
thoughts. &lsquo;Yes, it says Saturday. And
it is on Saturday that the Lord Chief is
coming down to stay over Sunday, is it not?
I thought so. I very much wish I could
induce her to go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not on that account, my boy, I hope?&rsquo;
Lady Bligh seemed slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
&lsquo;Partly,&rsquo; said Alfred, speaking firmly and
distinctly, but not without an effort; &lsquo;partly
on that account, but by no means altogether.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She could not go without you,&rsquo; remarked
Lady Bligh; &lsquo;and they do not ask you civilly,
to say the least of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She <em>could</em> go without me,&rsquo; returned Alfred
emphatically. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s more, I want her
to. It&rsquo;s she that won&rsquo;t hear of it. These
are quite old and intimate friends of Gladys
and her father. She might easily spend a
week with them alone, without me. Mother&mdash;I
think she would like it so, if only she
would go! They are probably free-and-easy,
roughish folks, and it would do her good, a
week with them. There would be no restraints&mdash;nay,
she has observed none here,
God knows!&mdash;but there there might be none
to observe. She could do and say what she
liked. She would hurt no one&rsquo;s feelings.
She would scandalise no one. And&mdash;do you
know what, mother?&mdash;I have got it into my
head that when she came back she would
see the difference, and appreciate your ways
here more than she ever might otherwise.
I have got it into my head that one week of
that kind, just now, would open her eyes for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
good and all. And I think&mdash;there might be
no more relapses! Yes, I thought that
before; but I was wrong, you see&mdash;after yesterday!
Besides, this week would bring us within
a few weeks of Scotland; and, after Scotland,
we shall have our own little place to go to&mdash;I
have almost settled upon one. But if I
went with her, restraint would go with her
too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His voice had broken more than once
with emotion. He commanded it with
difficulty, and it became hard and unnatural.
In this tone he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Besides&mdash;it would be more comfortable
for every one if she were not here with the
Lord Chief Justice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not say that&mdash;do not think that!&rsquo;
said Lady Bligh; but faintly, because her
heart echoed his sentiment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no disguising it&mdash;my wife&rsquo;s
dynamite!&rsquo; said Alfred, with a short, harsh
laugh. &lsquo;Only an explosion is worse at one
time than at another.&rsquo; He went hastily from
the room, neither of them having referred
more directly to the scandalous scene in the
Park.</p>

<p>He went straight to his wife, to try once
more to coax her into accepting the Barringtons&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
invitation. But it was of no use. She
would not listen to him. She would go
nowhere without her husband; she should
write that to Ada plainly.</p>

<p>Later in the morning, Lady Bligh, of
her own deliberate design, came in contact
with her daughter-in-law. Gladys attempted
escape. Lady Bligh caught her by
the hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are angry, Gladys!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys said nothing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think <em>you</em> are the one to be angry,&rsquo;
Lady Bligh said, nettled by the other&rsquo;s sullen
manner.</p>

<p>Gladys raised her eyes swiftly from the
ground; they were filled with bitterness.
&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t I a right to be what I like with
myself?&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I am angry with no
one else. But I shall never forgive myself&mdash;no,
nor I won&rsquo;t be forgiven either; I am
hopeless! I feared it before; now I know it.
Let me go, Lady Bligh!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She broke away, and found a quiet spot,
by-and-by, among the trees by the
river.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If only I were in <em>there</em>!&rsquo; cried Gladys,
out of the tumult of shame and rebellion
within her. &lsquo;In there&mdash;or else back in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
Bush! And one is possible and easy; and the
other is neither!&rsquo;</p>

<p>By a single grotesque act she had brought
her happiness, and not hers alone, to wreck
and ruin!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">A SOCIAL INFLICTION</span></h2>


<p>Happily for all concerned, there was something
else to be thought about that day: it
was the day of Lady Bligh&rsquo;s garden-party.</p>

<p>The British garden-party is possibly unique
among the social gatherings of the world.
It might be a revelation to most intelligent
foreigners. It is held, of course, in the fresh
air; the weather, very likely, is all that can be
desired. The lawn is soft and smooth and
perfectly shaven; sweeping shadows fall
athwart it from the fine old trees. The flower-beds
are splendidly equipped; their blended
odours hover in the air. The leaves whisper
and the birds sing. The scene is agreeably
English. But let in the actors. They are
English too. The hostess on the lawn receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
the people, and slipping them through her busy
fingers into solitude and desolation&mdash;anywhere,
anywhere, out of her way; the stout
people in the flimsy chairs, in horrid jeopardy
which they alone do not realise; the burly,
miserable male supers, in frock-coats and silk
hats, standing at ease (but only in a technical
sense) around the path, ashamed to eat the
ices that the footman proffers them, ashamed
of having nobody to talk to but their sisters
or wives&mdash;who are worse than no one: it is
so feeble to be seen speaking only to <em>them</em>.
This is the British garden-party in the small
garden, in the suburbs. In the large garden,
in the country, you may lose yourself among
the fruit-trees without being either missed or
observed; but this is not a point in favour
of the institution. Even in suburban districts
there are bold spirits that aspire to make
their garden-parties different from everybody
else&rsquo;s, and not dull; who write &lsquo;Lawn
Tennis&rsquo; in the corner of their invitation-cards
before ascertaining the respective measurements
of a regulation court and of their own
back gardens. But beware of these ambitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
souls; they add yet another terror to the
British garden-party. To go in flannels and
find everybody else in broadcloth; to be received
as a champion player in consequence, and
asked whether you have &lsquo;entered at Wimbledon&rsquo;;
to be made to play in every set (because
you are the only man in flannels), with
terrible partners, against adversaries more
terrible still&mdash;with the toes of the onlookers
on the side lines of the court, and the dining-room
windows in peril should you but swing
back your racket for your usual smashing
service, once in a way, to show them how it
is done: all this amounts to spending your
afternoon in purgatory, in the section reserved
for impious lawn-tennis players. Yet nothing
is more common. The lawn must be utilised,
either for lawn-tennis or for bowls (played
with curates), or by the erection of a tent for
refreshments. By Granville&rsquo;s intervention,
the Blighs had the refreshment-tent.</p>

<p>Lady Bligh would not have given garden-parties
at all, could she have been &lsquo;at home&rsquo;
in any other way; but as her set was largely
composed of people living actually in town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
who would not readily come ten miles out for
a dinner-party, still less for an after-dinner
party, she had really no choice in the matter.
Still, Lady Bligh&rsquo;s garden-parties were not
such very dull affairs after all. They were
immensely above the suburban average. To
the young and the curious they held out
attractions infinitely greater than garden-party
lawn-tennis, though these could not be
advertised on the cards of invitation. For
instance, you were sure of seeing a celebrity
or two, if not even the highest dignitaries,
with some of the dignity in their pockets.
And it is inexpressible how delightful it was
to come across a group of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Judges gorging strawberry ices unblushingly
in a quiet corner of the marquee. On the
present occasion, when the stoutest and most
pompous Q.C. at the Bar&mdash;Mr Merivale&mdash;sat
down on the slenderest chair in the garden,
and thence, suddenly, upon the grass, the
situation was full of charm for Granville and
some of his friends, who vied with one another
in a right and proper eagerness to help the great
man to his feet. Even Gladys (who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
so very far from being in a laughing mood)
laughed at this; though she was not aware
that the stout gentleman was a Q.C., nor of
the significance of those initials, had any one
told her so.</p>

<p>But this was all the entertainment that
Gladys extracted from the long afternoon.
She was amused, at the moment, in spite of
herself; she was not amused a second time.
She kept ingeniously in the background.
Alfred was attentive to her, of course, but
not foolishly attentive, this afternoon. And
Granville introduced to her one of his clean-shaven
friends, whom Gladys conversed with
for perhaps a minute. She was also presented
by the Judge&mdash;in his recent genial, fatherly
manner&mdash;to one or two of his colleagues.
Plainly, the disgraceful scene in Hyde Park
had not yet reached Sir James&rsquo;s ears. But
that scandal was being discreetly discussed by
not a few of the guests. Gladys suspected as
much, though she did not know it. She
imagined herself to be a not unlikely subject
of conversation in any case, but quite a
tempting one in the light of her last escapade.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
But this idea did not worry her. In some
moods it is possible to be acutely self-conscious
without being the least sensitive;
Gladys&rsquo;s present mood was one. More often
than at the people, she gazed at the window of
her own room, and longed to be up there, alone.
She neither took any interest in what was
going on around her, nor cared what the
people were whispering concerning her. No
doubt they <em>were</em> whispering, but what did it
matter? Misery is impervious to scorn and
ridicule and contempt. These things wound
the vanity; misery deadens it. Gladys was
miserable.</p>

<p>Among the later arrivals was Miss Travers.
Her father could not come: he was doing the
fair thing by the Party and his constituents:
it was his first term. Miss Travers came
alone, and intended to go back alone, the
later the better. Whitechapel had made her
fearless and independent. She rather hoped
to be asked to stop to dinner: some people
were certain to stay, for the Blighs were
uncommonly hospitable, and in many things
quite unconventional; and Miss Travers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
intended to be one of those people, if she
got the opportunity. She also intended
to cultivate the most original specimen of
her sex that she had ever yet met with;
and for this she tried to make the opportunity.</p>

<p>But the most original of her sex was also
one of the most slippery, when she liked; she
dodged Miss Travers most cleverly, until the
pursuer was herself pursued, and captured.
Her captor was a rising solicitor, a desirable
gentleman and an open admirer; but he did
not improve his chances by that interview.
Miss Travers was disappointed, almost annoyed.
The unlucky lawyer sought to make
her smile with a story: the story of the
&lsquo;<em>coo-ee!</em>&rsquo; as he had heard it. He knew Miss
Travers intimately; her appreciation of
humour was vast, for a woman; he felt sure
she would be tickled. But, unfortunately,
the version he had heard was already fearfully
exaggerated, and, as Miss Travers drew
him on gently, yet without smiling as he
wished her to, the good fellow improvised
circumstances still more aggravating and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
scandalous; and then&mdash;sweet Miss Travers
annihilated him in a breath.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was in their carriage at the time, myself;
but&mdash;you will excuse my saying so&mdash;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have recognised the incident from
your description!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was a staggerer; but Miss Travers did
not follow up the blow. She reproved him, it
is true, but so kindly, and with such evident
solicitude for his moral state, that the wretch
was in ecstasies in two minutes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;At all events,&rsquo; he said, with enthusiasm,
&lsquo;she has you for her champion! I won&rsquo;t hear
another word about her; <em>I&rsquo;ll</em> champion her too!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you spoke to her for one moment,&rsquo;
Miss Travers replied, &lsquo;you would own yourself
that she is charming. You never saw
such eyes!&rsquo;</p>

<p>This the lawyer seemed to question, by
the rapt manner in which he gazed into Miss
Travers&rsquo;s own eyes; but the speech was the
prettier for being left unspoken; and here the
lawyer showed some self-restraint and more
wisdom. But immediately the lady left him:
she had descried her quarry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
Gladys dodged again, and, passing quickly
through the tent, heard two words that sent
the blood to her cheeks. The words were in
close conjunction&mdash;&lsquo;<em>coo-ee!</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;disgrace.&rsquo;
Without turning to see who had uttered them&mdash;the
voice was unfamiliar&mdash;she hurried
through into the house, and finding the little
morning-room quite empty, went in there to
sit down and think.</p>

<p>She was not wounded by the chance words;
her lifeless pride had not quickened and
become vulnerable all in a moment&mdash;it was
not that. But it was this: what she had done,
she realised now, for the first time, fully.
Disgrace! She had disgraced Lady Bligh,
Sir James, Alfred, Granville, all of them; in
a public place, she, the interloper in the
family, had brought down disgrace upon them
all. Disgrace!&mdash;that was what people were
saying. Disgrace to the Blighs&mdash;that was why
she minded what the people said. And she
minded this so much, now, that she rocked
herself to and fro where she sat, and
wrung her large strong hands, and groaned
aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
And it was not only once; she had disgraced
them many times. And all had been
forgiven. But this could never be forgiven.</p>

<p>If only she had never married poor Alfred;
if only she had never come among his family,
to behave worse than their very servants!
The servants? Would Bella Bunn have
behaved so in her place? It was not likely,
for even Bella had been able to give her hints,
and she had consulted Bella upon points on
which she would have been ashamed to confess
her ignorance, even to Alfred. But,
in spite of all their goodness and patience, she
had brought only unhappiness to them all;
there could be no more happiness for them or
for her while she remained in the family.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I ought to be dead&mdash;or back in the Bush!&rsquo;
she cried again, in her heart. &lsquo;Oh, if only one
was as easy as the other!&rsquo;</p>

<p>These were her sole longings. Of the
two, one was strong and not new (being intensified,
not produced, by the circumstances),
but sufficiently impracticable. The other was
easy to compass, easy to the point of temptation,
but as yet not nearly so strong, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
entirely the impulse of events. But neither
longing was at present anything more than
a longing; no purpose showed through either
yet. The reality of Alfred&rsquo;s love, the feeling
that it would kill him to lose her, was accountable
for this. Gladys&rsquo;s resolution was, so
far, a blank tablet, not because purpose was
absent, but because it was not yet become
visible.</p>

<p>A rough analogy may be borrowed from
the sensitive film used for the production of
a photographic negative. The impression is
taken, yet the film remains blank as it was
before, until the proper acid is applied, when
the impression becomes visible.</p>

<p>Now, a moral acid, acting upon that blank
tablet of the mind, would produce a precisely
similar effect. Suppose Gladys became convinced
that Alfred would be a happier man
without her, that it would be even a relief to
him to lose her: this would supply the moral
acid.</p>

<p>The effect of this moral acid would coincide
with that of the photographer&rsquo;s acid.
In either case something that had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
imperceptible hitherto would now start out in
sharp outline. The blank film would yield
the negative picture; the vague longings of
Gladys would take the shape of two distinct
alternatives, one of them inevitable.</p>

<p>Suppose this happened, one of these alternatives
was so simple as to be already, in its
embryo state, something of a temptation;
while the other would remain a moral impossibility.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the Bride
confronted no such alternatives yet, but
merely experienced vague, passionate longings.
In this state of mind, however, but one drop
of acid was needed to produce &lsquo;development.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">&lsquo;HEAR MY PRAYER!&rsquo;</span></h2>


<p>Miss Travers did not, after all, succeed in
cornering Gladys at the garden-party, but
she did contrive to get herself asked to stay
later, and without much difficulty (she
would probably have found it far more
difficult to go with the rest&mdash;hostesses were
tenacious of Miss Travers); and after
dinner, when the ladies went off to the
drawing-room, her stubborn waiting was at
last rewarded.</p>

<p>Some other people had stayed to dinner
also, in the same informal way, and among
them one or two of Granville&rsquo;s friends. These
young men had come to the garden-party by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
no advice of Gran&rsquo;s&mdash;in fact, those who
chanced to have mentioned to him Lady
Bligh&rsquo;s invitation he had frankly told to stay
away and not to be fools. But, having
come, he insisted on their staying. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;you deserve compensation, you fellows;
and the Judge&rsquo;s wine, though I say it, hasn&rsquo;t
a fault&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s spoiling a man for his
club&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And while the young men put the truth
of this statement to a more earnest test
than could be applied before the ladies
left the table, Miss Travers, in the drawing-room,
at last had Gladys to herself. And
Miss Travers was sadly disappointed&mdash;as,
perhaps, she deserved to be. Gladys had
very little to say to her. As a matter
of fact, it was no less irksome to the
Bride to listen than to talk herself. But
they happened to be sitting close to the
piano, and it was not long before a
very happy thought struck Gladys, which
she instantly expressed in the abrupt
question:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You sing, Miss Travers, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
&lsquo;In a way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In a way! I&rsquo;ve heard all about the
way!&rsquo; Gladys smiled; Miss Travers thought
the smile sadly changed since yesterday.
&lsquo;Sing now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You really want me to?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, really. And you must.&rsquo; Gladys
opened the piano.</p>

<p>Miss Travers sang a little song that Gladys
had never heard before, accompanying herself
from memory. She sang very sweetly, very
simply&mdash;in a word, uncommonly well. The
voice, to begin with, was an exceptionally
sound soprano, but the secret and charm of it
all was, of course, in the way she used her
voice. Gladys had asked for a song to escape
from a chat, but she had forgotten her motive
in asking&mdash;she had forgotten that she <em>had</em>
asked for it&mdash;she had forgotten much that it
had seemed impossible to forget, even thus,
for one moment&mdash;before the song was half
finished. Very possibly, with Gladys, who
knew nothing of music, this was an appeal to
the senses only; but it gave her some peaceful,
painless moments when such were rare;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
and it left her, with everything coming back
to her, it is true, but with a grateful heart.
So grateful, indeed, was Gladys that she forgot
to express her thanks until Miss Travers
smilingly asked her how she liked that song;
and then, instead of answering, she went
over to where Lady Bligh was sitting, bent
down, and asked a question, which was
answered in a whisper.</p>

<p>Then Gladys came back to the piano.
&lsquo;Yes, I <em>do</em> like that song, very, very much;
and I beg your pardon for not answering you,
Miss Travers, but I was thinking of something
else; and I want you, please, to sing Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hear my Prayer!&rdquo;&rsquo; These words
came quickly&mdash;they were newly learnt from
Lady Bligh.</p>

<p>Miss Travers could not repress a smile.
&lsquo;Do you know what you are asking me
for?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; for what we heard in church last
Sunday evening. That&rsquo;s the name, because
I&rsquo;ve just asked Lady Bligh. I would rather
you sang that than anything else in the
world!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
&lsquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Miss Travers was puzzled by
the Bride&rsquo;s expression; she would have given
anything not to refuse, yet what could she
do? &lsquo;But&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing one
can sit down and sing&mdash;<em>really</em> it isn&rsquo;t. It
wants a chorus, and it is very long and
elaborate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; Gladys seemed strangely disappointed.
&lsquo;But there was one part&mdash;the part
I liked&mdash;where the chorus didn&rsquo;t come in, I
am sure. It was sung by a boy. You could
do it so much better! It was about the
wings of a dove, and the wilderness. You
know, I come from the wilderness myself&rsquo;&mdash;the
Bride smiled faintly&mdash;&lsquo;and I thought I&rsquo;d
never heard anything half so lovely
before; though of course I&rsquo;ve heard very
little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No matter how little you have heard,
you will never hear anything much more
beautiful than that,&rsquo; said Miss Travers, with
sympathetic enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Since I cannot hear it now, however,
there is an end of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys sighed, but her eyes pleaded still;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
it was impossible to look in them long and
still resist. Miss Travers looked but for a
moment, then, turning round to the keys, she
softly touched a chord. &lsquo;I will try the little
bit you liked,&rsquo; she whispered, kindly, &lsquo;whatever
I make of it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>What she did make of it is unimportant,
except in its effect upon Gladys. This effect
was very different from that produced a few
minutes before by the song; this, at least,
was no mere titillation of the senses by
agreeable sounds. And it differed quite as
much from the effect produced by the same
thing in church on Sunday, when Gladys,
after being surprised into listening, had
listened only to the words. Then, indeed, the
music had seemed sweet and sad, but to-night
each note palpitated with a shivering, tremulous
yearning, dropping into her soul a relief
as deep as that of sorrow unbosomed, a comfort
as soothing as the comfort of tears. And
there was now an added infinity of meaning
in the words; though it was the words that
had thrilled her then&mdash;then, before she had
brought all the present misery to pass.</p>

<p>It is only a few bars, the solo here; and
at the point where the chorus catches up the
refrain Miss Travers softly ceased. She
turned round slowly on the stool, then rose
up quickly in surprise. Her ardent listener
was gone. And as Miss Travers stood by the
piano, peering with raised eyebrows into
every corner of the room, and out into the
night through the open French window, the
men entered the room in a body&mdash;she was
surrounded.</p>

<p>But Gladys had stepped softly through
the window on to the lawn, re-entered the
house by another way, and stolen swiftly up
to her room. The last strains came to her
through the open window of the drawing-room,
and in at her own window, at which
Gladys now knelt: and this short passage
through the outer air brought them upward
on the breath of the night, rarefied and
softened as though from the lips of far-off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
angels: and so they reached her trembling
ears.</p>

<p>The scent of roses was in the air. The
moon was rising, and its rays spanned the
river with a broad bridge of silver, against
which some of the foliage at the garden-end
stood out in fine filigree. It was a heavenly
night; it was a sweet and tranquil place;
but yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Gladys had been home-sick before; she
had been miserable and desperate for many,
many hours; but at this moment it seemed as
though hitherto she had never known what
it was to pant and pray in real earnest for
her old life and her own country. She was
almost as a weak woman in the transports
of spiritual fervour, her vision riveted upon
some material mental picture, the soul for
one ecstatic instant separated from the flesh&mdash;only
Gladys missed the ecstasy.</p>

<p>There was no light in the room; and the
girl remained so entirely motionless, as she
knelt, that her glossy head, just raised above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
the level of the sill, would have seemed in
the moonlight a mere inanimate accessory, if
it had been seen at all. But only the bats
could have seen Gladys, and they did not; at
all events, it was the touch of a bat&rsquo;s wing
upon the forehead that recalled her to herself,
making her aware of voices within earshot,
immediately below her window. Her room
was over the dining-room. The voices were
men&rsquo;s voices, and the scent of cigars reached
her as well. She could hear distinctly, but
she never would have listened had she not
heard her own name spoken; and then&mdash;the
weakness of the moment prevented her from
rising.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said one of the voices, &lsquo;not a bit of
it; oh dear, no! Gladys has her good points;
and, frankly, I am getting rather to like her.
But she is impossible in her position. The
whole thing was a fearful mistake, which poor
old Alfred will live to repent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The voice was unmistakable; it was
Granville&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But&rsquo;&mdash;and the other voice was that of
Granville&rsquo;s most intimate friend, whom he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
introduced to Gladys during the course of the
afternoon&mdash;&lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t he repent it already, think
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, I&rsquo;m not sure that he
doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Granville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you ask me,&rsquo; said his friend, &lsquo;I should
say there isn&rsquo;t a doubt of it. I&rsquo;ve been
watching him pretty closely. Mark my
words, he&rsquo;s a miserable man!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m half inclined to agree with
you,&rsquo; said Granville. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think so two
or three days since, but now I do. You see,
there are camels&rsquo; backs and there are last
straws (though I wish there were no proverbs);
and there never was a heavier straw
than yesterday&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;gad! &rsquo;twas as heavy as
the rest of the load! I mean the perfectly
awful scene in the Park, which you know about,
and the whole town knows about, and the low
papers will publish, confound them! Yes,
I believe you&rsquo;re right; he <em>can&rsquo;t</em> get over
this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor chap!&rsquo; said Granville&rsquo;s friend.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You may well say that. Alfred is no
genius&rsquo;&mdash;Granville was, apparently&mdash;&lsquo;but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
has position; he has money&mdash;luckily for
him; he means to settle down in the country
somewhere, and, no doubt, he&rsquo;d like to be
somebody in the county. But how could
he? Look at his wife!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There ought to be a separation,&rsquo; said the
friend, feelingly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite as bad as
that,&rsquo; said Granville, wearing ship. &lsquo;Anyway,
there never will be one; you may trust her
for that. And, I must own, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
all the main chance with her, either; they&rsquo;re
sufficiently spooney. Why, she will not even
leave him for a week on a visit, though, as
I understand, he&rsquo;s doing his best to persuade
her to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys&rsquo;s hands tightened upon the woodwork
of the window-frame.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t persuade her to?&rsquo; cried the friend.
&lsquo;What did I tell you? Why, Lord love you,
he wants to get rid of her already!&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was rather strong, even for an intimate
friend, and even though the intimate
friend had drunk a good deal of wine. Granville&rsquo;s
tone cooled suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll drop the subject, I think. My
cigar&rsquo;s done, and you&rsquo;ve smoked as much as
is good for you. You can do as you like,
but I&rsquo;m going inside.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Their footsteps sounded down the gravel-path;
then the sound ceased; they had gone
in by the drawing-room window.</p>

<p>Gladys had never once altered her position;
she did not alter it now. The moon rose
high in the purple sky, and touched her head
with threads of silver. It was as though
gray hairs had come upon her while she
knelt. The sudden turning of the door-handle,
and a quick step upon the threshold,
aroused her. It was Alfred come for an
easier coat. The people were gone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;<em>Gladys!</em>&rsquo; he cried. She rose stiffly
to her feet, and confronted him with her
back to the moonlight. &lsquo;Up here&mdash;alone?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t miss me, then?&rsquo; Her tone
was low and hoarse&mdash;the words ran into one
another in their hurried, eager utterance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; cried Alfred; &lsquo;to tell you the
truth, I didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He seemed to her in better spirits than he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
had been all day; his voice was full and
cheery, and his manner brisk. Why? Evidently
the evening had gone off very agreeably.
Why? Was it because he had got rid of
her for an hour? Was it, then, true that he
was doing his best to get rid of her for a week&mdash;that
he would be only too glad to get rid
of her for ever? It was as though a poniard
were being held to her breast. She paused,
and nerved herself to speak calmly, before,
as it were, baring her bosom to the steel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alfred,&rsquo; she said at length, with slow
distinctness, but not with the manner of one
who is consciously asking a question of life
or death, &lsquo;I have been thinking it over, about
the Barringtons; and I think I <em>should</em> like to
go to them on Saturday after all. May I
go?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;May you?&rsquo; Alfred fairly shouted. &lsquo;I am
only too delighted, Gladdie! Of course you
may.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poniard went in&mdash;to the hilt.</p>

<p>So delighted was Alfred that he caught her
in his arms and kissed her. Her cheek was
quite cold, her frame all limp. Though she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
reeled on her feet, she seemed to shrink
instinctively from his support.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Gladdie?&rsquo; he cried,
in sudden alarm. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;are you
ill? Stop, I&rsquo;ll fetch&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She interrupted him in a whisper.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fetch no one.&rsquo; She dropped one hand
upon the dressing-table, leant her weight
upon it, and motioned him back with the
other. &lsquo;I am not ill; I only was faint, just
for a moment. I am all right now. There,
that&rsquo;s a long breath; I can speak quite
properly again. You see, it was only a passing
faintness. I must have fallen asleep by the
window. I was enjoying the lovely night,
and that must have done it. There, I am
only tired now, and want&mdash;sleep!&rsquo;</p>


<p class="break">That acid had been applied, and not in
drops. Its work was complete.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE FIRST PARTING</span></h2>


<p>It was Saturday forenoon, and everything
was ready for the departure of Gladys.
Moreover, the moment had come. Garrod
was at the door with the carriage; the phlegmatic
stable-boy, having performed feats of
unsuspected strength with the luggage, had
retired into his own peculiar shell, and lurked
in sullen humility at the far side of the
horse; while Mr Dix figured imposingly
in the hall. Alfred was here too, waiting for
Gladys to come down. But Gladys was
upstairs saying good-bye to Lady Bligh, and
lingering over the parting somewhat strangely,
for one who was going away for a week only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
&lsquo;If I hear any more such absurd talk,&rsquo;
Lady Bligh said at last, and with some impatience,
&lsquo;about forgiveness and the like, I
shall punish you by not allowing you to leave
me at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is too late to do that,&rsquo; Gladys
hastily put in. &lsquo;But oh, Lady Bligh!
if only you knew how happy you have
made me&mdash;how happily I go away, having
your forgiveness for everything, for everything&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Except for what you are saying now.
How wildly you do talk, child! One would
think you were going for ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who knows, Lady Bligh? There are
accidents every day. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
thankful to be leaving like this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Bligh hated sentimentality. Only
the intense earnestness of the girl&rsquo;s voice
and manner restrained her from laughing;
sentimentality was only fit to be laughed
at; but this was sentimentality of a puzzling
kind.</p>

<p>A minute later, with passionate kisses and
incoherent expressions, out of all proportion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
to the occasion, and fairly bewildering to
poor Lady Bligh, Gladys was gone.</p>

<p>Alfred scanned her narrowly as they
drove to the station. By the way she kept
turning round to gaze backward, you would
have thought her anxious to &lsquo;see the last of&rsquo;
things, as small boys are when the holidays
are over, and bigger boys when they go finally
out into the world. Alfred was going with
her to Liverpool Street. She had refused to
go at all if he took her (as he wanted to) all
the way into Suffolk, to return himself by
the next train.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladdie,&rsquo; he said, after watching her
closely, &lsquo;you look cut up; is it from saying
good-bye to the <i>mater</i>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose it must be&mdash;if I really look
like that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is still, perhaps, some soreness&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, there is none now,&rsquo; said Gladys,
quickly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then what is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only that it is so dreadful, saying good-bye!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My darling!&mdash;by the way you talk you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
might be going for good and all. And it is
only for a week.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She did not answer, but pressed the hand
that closed over her own.</p>

<p>During the half-hour&rsquo;s run to Waterloo
he continued to glance furtively, and not
without apprehension, at her face. It was
unusually pale; dark rings encircled the eyes,
and the eyes were unusually brilliant.</p>

<p>They had a compartment to themselves.
He held her hand all the way, and she his,
like a pair of moonstruck young lovers;
and, for the most part, they were as
silent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have not been yourself these last
few days,&rsquo; he said at length; &lsquo;I am glad you
are going.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And I am glad of that,&rsquo; she answered.</p>

<p>Her tone was odd.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I shall be wretched while you are
gone,&rsquo; he quickly added.</p>

<p>She made no reply to this; it seemed to
her an afterthought. But, if it was, it grew
upon him with swift and miserable effect as
the minutes remaining to them gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
diminished. When they drove up to Liverpool
Street he was in the depths of dejection.</p>

<p>It was their first parting.</p>

<p>She insisted on sending the necessary
telegram to the Barringtons herself. His
depression made him absent, and even remiss.
He stood listlessly by while she filled in the
form; at any other time he would have done
this for her, or at least looked over her
shoulder&mdash;humorously to check the spelling;
but this afternoon he was less attentive in little
things than she had ever known him, because
she had never known him so depressed.</p>

<p>It was their first parting.</p>

<p>He had got her a compartment to herself,
but only at her earnest insistence; <em>he</em> had
spoken for a carriage full of people, or the
one reserved for ladies&mdash;anything but solitary
confinement. It was the Cambridge
train; there were few stoppages and no
changes.</p>

<p>Gladys was ensconced in her corner. For
the moment, her husband sat facing her.
Four minutes were left them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have a Don in the next carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
to you; an ancient and wonderfully amiable
one, I should say,&rsquo; observed Alfred, with
a sickly attempt at levity. &lsquo;I wish you were
under his wing, my dear!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys made a respondent effort, an infinitely
harder one. &lsquo;No, thanks,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;not <em>me</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, I say! Is it nervousness or vanity?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is neither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yet you look nervous, Gladdie, joking
apart&mdash;and, honestly, I never felt less like
joking in my life. And you are pale, my
darling; and your hand is so cold!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She withdrew the hand.</p>

<p>But one more minute was left. &lsquo;Better
get out, sir,&rsquo; said the guard, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll lock the
lady in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gladys felt a shiver pass through her
entire frame. With a supreme effort she
controlled herself. They kissed and clasped
hands. Then Alfred stepped down heavily
on to the platform.</p>

<p>The minute was a long one; these minutes
always are. It was an age in passing, a flash
to look back upon. These minutes are among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
the strangest accomplishments of the sorcerer
Time.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is dreadful to let you go alone, darling,
like this,&rsquo; he said, standing on the foot-board
and leaning in. &lsquo;At least you ought to have
had Bunn with you. You might have given
way in that, Gladdie.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she whispered tremulously; &lsquo;I&mdash;I
like going alone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must write at once, Gladdie.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To-morrow; but you could only get it latish
on Monday.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The bell was ringing. You know the
clangour of a station bell; of all sounds the
last that it resembles is that of the funeral
knell; yet this was its echo in the heart of
Gladys.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s only for a week, after all, isn&rsquo;t
it, Gladdie? It will be the weariest week of
my life, I know. But I shan&rsquo;t mind&mdash;after
all, it&rsquo;s my own doing&mdash;if only you come
back with a better colour. You have been
so pale, Gladdie, these last few days&mdash;pale
and excitable. But it&rsquo;s only a week, my
darling, eh?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
She could not answer.</p>

<p>The guard blew his whistle. There was
an end of the minute at last.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stand back,&rsquo; she whispered: her voice
was stifled with tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Back?&rsquo;&mdash;Alfred peered up into her face,
and a sudden pallor spread upon his own&mdash;&lsquo;with
your dear eyes full of tears, where I
never yet saw tears before? Back?&mdash;God
forgive me for thinking of it, I&rsquo;ll come with
you yet!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He made as though to dive headlong
through the window; but, looking him full
in the eyes through her tears, his girl-wife
laid a strong hand on each of his shoulders
and forced him back. He staggered as the
platform came under his feet. The train was
already moving. He stood and gazed.</p>

<p>Gladys was waving to him, and smiling
through her tears. So she continued until
she could see him no more. Then she fell
back upon the cushions, and, for a time, consciousness
left her.</p>

<p>It was their first parting.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">TRACES</span></h2>


<p>Alfred did not become unconscious, nor
even feel faint: he was a man. But
he did feel profoundly wretched. He
tried to shake off this feeling, but
failed. Later, on his way back through
the City, he stopped somewhere to try
and lunch it off, and with rather better
success. He was a man: he proceeded
to throw the blame upon the woman. It
was Gladys who had supplied all the sentiment
(and there had been an absurd amount
of it) at their parting; it was the woman
who had exaggerated this paltry week&rsquo;s
separation, until it had assumed, perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
for them both&mdash;at the moment&mdash;abnormal
dimensions; he, the man, was blameless. If
<em>his</em> way had obtained, she should have gone
away in highest spirits, instead of in tears&mdash;and
all for one insignificant week! He
should write her a serious, if not a severe,
letter on the subject. So Alfred went down
to Twickenham in quite a valiant mood to
face his week of single-blessedness, and to
affect a droll appreciation of it in the popular,
sprightly manner of the long-married
man.</p>

<p>But the miserable feeling returned&mdash;if,
indeed, it had ever been chased fairly away;
and it returned with such force that Alfred
was obliged to own at last that it, too, was
exaggerated and out of all proportion to the
exciting cause. He, in his turn, was sentimentalising
as though Gladys had gone for
a term of years. He was conscious of this;
but he could not help it. His thoughts
seemed bound to the parting of this Saturday,
powerless to fly forward to the reunion
of the next. A vague, dim sense of finality
was the restraining bond; but this sense was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
not long to remain dim or vague. Meanwhile,
so far as Alfred was concerned, the
Sunday that followed was wrapped in a
gloom that not even the genial presence of
the distinguished (but jocular) guest could
in any way pierce or dissipate. Nevertheless,
it contained the last tranquil moments that
Alfred was to know at that period of his
life; for it led him to the verge of an ordeal
such as few men are called upon to
undergo.</p>

<p>He was not a little surprised on the Monday
morning to find among the letters by the
first post one addressed to his wife. She had
received scarcely any letters since her arrival
in England&mdash;two or three from tradesmen,
an invitation or so, nothing from Australia;
but this letter was directed in a large, bold
hand, with which Alfred fancied he was
not wholly unfamiliar; and he suddenly
remembered that he had seen it before in Miss
Barrington&rsquo;s note of invitation. Now, the
post-mark bore the name of the town to which
Gladys had booked from Liverpool Street,
and the date of the day before; and how could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
Miss Barrington write to Gladys at Twickenham,
when Gladys was staying with Miss
Barrington in Suffolk?</p>

<p>He tore open the envelope, and his hand
shook as he did so. When he had read to
the end of the letter, which was very short,
his face was gray and ghastly; his eyes were
wild and staring; he sank helplessly into a
chair. The note ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dearest Glad</span>,&mdash;We are <em>so</em> disappointed,
you can&rsquo;t think. As for me, I&rsquo;ve been in the
sulks ever since your telegram came this
afternoon. What <em>ever can</em> have prevented
your coming, at the <em>very last minute</em>&mdash;for your
wire from <em>Liverpool Street</em>? Do write at once,
for I&rsquo;m <em>horribly</em> anxious, to your loving</p>

<p class="sigright">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Ada</span>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;PS.&mdash;And do <em>come</em> at once, if it&rsquo;s nothing
serious.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Alfred read the letter a second time, and
an extraordinary composure came over him.</p>

<p>He folded the letter, restored it to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
envelope, and put the envelope in his pocket.
Then he looked at the clock. It wanted a
quarter to eight. The Judge was no doubt
up and about somewhere; but none of the
others were down. Alfred rang the bell,
and left word that he had received a letter
begging an early interview on important
business, and that he would breakfast in town.</p>

<p>Alfred was stunned; but he had formed
a plan. This plan he proceeded to put into
effect; or rather, once formed, the plan
evolved itself into mechanical action without
further thought. For some hours following
he did not perfectly realise either what he
was doing or why he was doing it. He never
thoroughly pulled himself together, until a
country conveyance, rattling him through
country lanes, whisked into a wooded drive,
and presently past a lawn where people were
playing lawn-tennis, and so to the steps of a
square, solid, country house. But he had all
his wits about him, and those sharpened to
the finest possible point, when he looked to
see whether Gladys was, or was not, among
the girls on the lawn. She was not. That was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
settled. He got out and rang the bell. He
inquired for Mr Barrington; Mr Barrington
was playing at lawn-tennis. In answer to
a question from the butler, Bligh said that
he would rather see Mr Barrington in the
house than go to him on the tennis-court.
He could wait until the set was finished.
He had come from London expressly to speak
for a few minutes with Mr Barrington. His
name would keep until Mr Barrington came;
but he was from Australia.</p>

<p>The last piece of information was calculated
to fetch Mr Barrington at once; and it
did. He came as he was, in his flannels, his
thick hairy arms bare to the elbow: a bronzed,
leonine man of fifty, with the hearty, hospitable
manner of the Colonial &lsquo;squatocracy.&rsquo; Alfred
explained in a few words who he was, and
why he had come. He had but one or two
questions to ask, and he asked them with
perfect self-possession. They elicited the
assurance that nothing had been heard of
Gladys in that quarter, beyond the brief
message received on the Saturday. Mr
Barrington found the telegram, and handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
it to his visitor. It read: &lsquo;Prevented coming
at last moment. Am writing&mdash;Gladys.&rsquo; By
the time of despatch, Bligh knew that it was
the message she had written out in his
presence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course she never wrote?&rsquo; he said
coolly to the squatter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We have received nothing,&rsquo; was the grave
answer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yet she started,&rsquo; said Alfred. &lsquo;I put her
in the train myself, and saw her off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His composure was incredible. The Australian
was more shaken than he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you make any inquiries on the line?&rsquo;
asked Barrington, after a pause.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Inquiries about what?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There might have been&mdash;an accident.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Bligh tapped the telegram with his finger.
&lsquo;This points to no accident,&rsquo; he said, grimly.
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; he added, more thoughtfully, &lsquo;one
might make inquiries down the line, as you
say. It might do good to make inquiries
all along the line.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say you have made
<em>none</em>?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
&lsquo;None,&rsquo; said Alfred, fetching a deep sigh.
&lsquo;I came here straight. I could think of
nothing else but getting here&mdash;and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;finding
her! I thought&mdash;I thought
there might be some&mdash;mistake!&rsquo; His voice
suddenly broke. The futility of the hope
that had sustained him for hours had dawned
upon him slowly, but now the cruel light hid
nothing any longer. She was not here; she
had not been heard of here; and precious
hours had been lost. He grasped his hat
and held out his trembling hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you! Thank you, Mr Barrington!
Now I must be off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where to?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To Scotland Yard. I should have gone
there first. But&mdash;I was mad, I think; I
thought there had been some mistake. Only
some mistake!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The squatter was touched to the soul. &lsquo;I
have known her, off and on, since she was
a baby,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Bligh&mdash;if you would only
let me, I should like to come with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred wrung the other&rsquo;s hand, but refused
his offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
&lsquo;No. Though I am grateful indeed, I
would rather go alone. It would do no good,
your coming; I should prefer to be alone. So
only one word more. Your daughter was a
great friend of Gladys; better not tell her
anything of this. For it may still be only some
wild freak, Mr Barrington&mdash;God knows what
it is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was evening when he reached London.
A whole day had been wasted. He stated
his case to the police; and then there was
no more to be done that night. With an
eagerness that all at once became feverish he
hastened back to Twickenham. It was late
when he arrived at the house; only Granville
was up; and, for an instant, Granville thought
his brother had been drinking. The delusion
lasted no longer than that instant. It was
not drink with Alfred: his excitement was
suppressed: he stood staring at Granville with
a questioning, eager expression, as though he
expected news. What could it mean? What
could be the explanation of such fierce excitement
in stolid Alfred, of all people in the
world?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
Granville thought of the one thing, or
rather of the one person, likely, and threw
out a feeler:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have you heard from Gladys?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Alfred, in a hollow voice. &lsquo;<em>Have
you seen her?</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was the last idea that had possessed
him: that Gladys might have come home,
that he might find her there on his return.
It was the second time that day that he had
cheated himself with vain, unreasoning
hopes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Seen her?&rsquo; Granville screwed in his eyeglass
tighter. &lsquo;Of course I haven&rsquo;t seen her!
How should we see her here, my good fellow,
when she&rsquo;s down in Suffolk?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred turned pale, and for an instant
stood glaring; then he burst into a harsh
laugh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You know how odd she is, Gran! I
thought she might have tired of her friends
and come back. She&rsquo;s capable of it, and I
feared it&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He left the room abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor chap!&rsquo; said Granville, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
sentient shake of the head; &lsquo;he <em>is</em> far gone,
if you like.&rsquo;</p>


<p class="break">Next morning Alfred walked into Scotland
Yard as the clocks were striking eleven. His
appointment was for that hour, and he had
striven successfully to keep it to the second;
though commonly he was a far from punctual
man. In point of fact, he had been sitting
and loitering about the Embankment for a
whole hour, waiting until the moment of his
appointment should come, as unwilling to go
to it a minute before the time as a minute
late. So he entered the Yard while Big Ben
was striking. And this was a young man
with a reputation for unpunctuality, and all-round
unbusinesslike, dilatory habits.</p>

<p>Moreover, for a man who, as a rule, was
not fastidious enough about such matters, his
appearance this morning was wellnigh immaculate.
Yet, perhaps, he had only sought,
by a long and elaborate toilet, to while away
the long, light hours of the early morning:
for, on looking at him closely, it was impossible
to believe that he had slept a wink.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
The fact is, abnormal circumstances had conduced
to bring about in Alfred an entirely
abnormal state of mind. In a word, and a
trite one, he was no longer himself. A crust
of insensibility had hardened upon him. Had
there been no news for him at all at the Yard
this morning, possibly this crust might have
been broken through: for he was better prepared
for one crushing blow than for the
bruises of repeated disappointment. Thus,
the very worst news might have affected him
less, at the moment, than no news, which is
supposed, popularly, to be of the best. But
there was some news.</p>

<p>Official investigation had thus far discovered
what a person of average intelligence,
with a little more presence of mind than
Alfred had shown, might have ascertained,
perhaps for himself. Yet the information
was important. Gladys had left the train,
with her luggage, two stations before her
destination. This was testified by the guard of
the train. But there was a later fact still. It
was certain that Gladys had returned to town
by the next up-train: for she had personally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
deposited her luggage in the cloak-room
at Liverpool Street between the hours of
six and seven on the Saturday evening. There
all trace of her was lost, for the present; but
it was extremely likely that fresh traces would
be forthcoming during the course of the day.</p>

<p>The simple nature of the inquiries that
had elicited the above information will be at
once apparent; but Alfred went away with
an exalted opinion of the blood-hound
sagacity of the police. In his present condition
of mind, his opinion, good or bad,
was not worth much. He went to a club
which he had not been in for years, and of
which he had long ceased to look upon himself
as a member; but his bankers, doubtless,
still paid his subscription; and in any case it
was not likely that he would be turned out.
He would find some quiet corner and sit down
and wait until the messenger came from
Scotland Yard; for, of course, something
more would be discovered during the course
of the day&mdash;had they not promised as much?
The quiet corner that he chose was an upstairs
window, from which there was a fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
glimpse of the river. The river fascinated
him most strangely to-day. During the hour
he had loitered on the Embankment, between
ten and eleven, he had raised his eyes but
seldom from the river.</p>

<p>He sat long at the window&mdash;so long that
minutes ran into hours and the summer
afternoon melted into the summer evening.
The room was a reading-room; the windows
were in snug recesses. Alfred had his recess
to himself for hours and hours. He was conscious
of no other presence; certainly no one
spoke to him: very possibly, with his beard,
no one recognised him.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking. He could not see
it from this window; but he could see the
heightened contrast of light and shadow
among the ripples of the river, and the
shadows deepening far away under Westminster
Bridge. This was where his gaze
rested. It was a stony gaze; his lips were
compressed and bloodless, his features pointed
and pale. A hideous vision filled his mind;
but it was a vision only; it had no meaning.
He did not realise it. He realised nothing....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
Some one came and asked if he was
Mr Bligh. It was a club servant. A man
awaited him below. Alfred went down; the
messenger from Scotland Yard was come at
last.</p>

<p>The messenger was the bearer of these few
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A lady&rsquo;s hat and jacket have been found
in the river below Blackwall. If you wish to
see them, they are here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Five minutes later Alfred walked into the
office in which he had heard the result of the
investigations that morning, and identified
instantly the jacket and hat awaiting his
inspection.</p>

<p>Gladys had gone away in them on Saturday.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">WAITING FOR THE WORST</span></h2>


<p>For the second time, it was Granville whom
Alfred first encountered on his return from
town. They met in the twilight. Dinner
was over, and Granville sauntered alone in
the bit of garden between the house and the
road, smoking a cigarette. Suddenly the gate
was opened, and the one brother, looking up,
saw the other coming quickly towards him
through the dusk.</p>

<p>It was too dark for the ready reading of
faces; but it struck Granville that the approaching
footsteps were hasty and unusual.
He recalled Alfred&rsquo;s unaccountable manner of
the night before. Indeed, all his movements,
during the past two days, were mysterious:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
up to London first thing in the morning, back
late, and not a word to any one; whereas the
whole household, as a general rule, were in
possession of most of Alfred&rsquo;s private plans
and hopes and fears. But Granville had no
time to speculate now. Alfred came straight
up to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to speak to you, Gran,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad I found you here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The step had been suspicious; the voice
was worse. It was calm enough, but it
was not Alfred&rsquo;s voice at all. Something
had happened. Granville put up his eyeglass;
but in that light it did not avail him
much.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let us sit down, then,&rsquo; said Granville,
leading the way to a seat under the trees.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is it about?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Alfred began, in set tones and orderly
phrases. The affectation of his manner was
almost grotesque.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want a kind of professional opinion
from you, Gran, about&mdash;let us say, about a
case that interests me, rather. That will be
near enough to the mark, I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
&lsquo;Delighted to help you, if I can.&rsquo; Granville
lounged back carelessly on the garden-seat,
but his keen glance lost not a line of the
other&rsquo;s profile, as Alfred bent forward with his
eyes upon the ground; and those lines
seemed strangely hardened.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you. The case is, briefly, this,&rsquo;
Alfred continued: &lsquo;somebody&mdash;no matter who&mdash;has
been missing for some days. The
number of days is of no consequence either.
The police were not informed immediately.
They only heard of it last night. But, this
afternoon, they found&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred checked himself, sat upright, shifted
his position, and met Granville&rsquo;s gaze.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What should you consider incontestable
evidence of drowning, Gran?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The body.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course. But you have to look for bodies.
What should you find, to make you search
with the absolute certainty of discovering
the body at last?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing else could make it an absolute
certainty. But lots of things would set you
searching&mdash;a hat, for instance.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
&lsquo;They have found her hat!&rsquo; said Alfred,
through his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Her</em> hat! Whose?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred stretched over, caught Granville&rsquo;s
arm in a nervous grip, and whispered rapidly
in his ear. In a moment Granville knew all.
But he did not speak immediately. When he
did speak, it was to ask questions. And there
was another unnatural voice now, besides
Alfred&rsquo;s&mdash;Granville&rsquo;s was quite soft.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Was she unhappy at all?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just the reverse, I thought, until last
week. You know what happened in the Park
yesterday week. She said some very wild
things after that, and spoke as though she
had never been quite happy here; she vowed
she would never forgive herself for what she
had done; and she said she wished she was
dead. Well, I did not think much about
her words; I thought more of what she had
done; I put down what she said to the shame
and temper of the moment, not to real unhappiness.
But, when I said good-bye to
her, then she <em>was</em> unhappy&mdash;more so than
I ever knew her before.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
From his tone, no one could have guessed
that he was speaking of his wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And you think she&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville could not bring his lips to utter
the words.</p>

<p>Alfred could. &lsquo;I think she has drowned
herself,&rsquo; he said calmly.</p>

<p>Granville shuddered. Callous as he was
himself by nature, callousness such as this he
could not have imagined possible; it was
horrible to see and to hear.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for some little time.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did it never occur to you,&rsquo; said Granville,
at last, &lsquo;that she might have drowned
herself without all this trouble, simply by
walking to the bottom of the garden
here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Alfred, sharply. His fingers
tightened upon Granville&rsquo;s arm. His voice
fell, oddly enough, into a natural tone.</p>

<p>Granville repeated his question.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Alfred, hoarsely, &lsquo;that never
crossed my mind. But there&rsquo;s something in
it. God bless you, Gran, for putting it into
my head! It&rsquo;s almost like a ray of hope&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
first. If I hadn&rsquo;t seen the things and
identified them as hers&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The things! You did not say there was
anything else besides the hat. What else was
there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The jacket she went away in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are sure it was hers?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You could swear to both hat and jacket?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville leapt to his feet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who throw their things into the water&rsquo;&mdash;he
asked, in strange excitement, for him&mdash;&lsquo;the
people who mean to sink or the people
who mean to swim&mdash;or the people who mean
to stay on the bank?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred stared at him blankly. Gradually
the light dawned upon him that had entered
Granville&rsquo;s quicker intelligence in a flash.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; whispered Alfred;
and, in a moment, his voice and his limbs
were trembling.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing very obscure,&rsquo; replied Granville,
with a touch of contempt, which, even then,
he could not manage to conceal (Alfred&rsquo;s slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
perception always had irritated him); &lsquo;simply
this: Gladys has <em>not</em> drowned herself. She
was never the girl to do it. She had too
much sense and vitality and courage. But
she may mean us to think there&rsquo;s an end of
her&mdash;God knows with what intention. She
may have gone off somewhere&mdash;God knows
where. We must find out&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, and nearly swore:
for Alfred was wringing his hand, and weeping
like a child.</p>

<p>Granville hated this, but bore it stoically.
It was now plain to him that Alfred had been
driven very nearly out of his senses: and
no wonder&mdash;Granville himself could as yet
scarcely realise or believe what he had heard.
And this outburst was the natural reaction
following upon an unnatural mental condition.
But <em>was</em> there any ground for hope? Granville
was less confident than he appeared
when he amended his last words and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I <em>will</em> find out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred wrung his hand again. He was
calmer now, but terribly shaken and shattered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
The weakness that he had been storing up
during the past two days had come over him,
as it were, in the lump. Granville led him to
his room. Alfred had never in his life before
known Granville half so good-natured and
sympathetic; he blessed him fervently.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You were her friend,&rsquo; he said, huskily.
&lsquo;She thought no end of you, Gran! You got
on so splendidly together, after the first few
days; and she was always talking about you.
Find her&mdash;find her for me, Gran; and God
bless you&mdash;and forgive her for this trick she
has played us!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville did not often feel contrition, or
remorse, or shame: but he felt all three just
then. He knew rather too well the measure
of his own kindness to Gladys. For the first
time in his life&mdash;and not, perhaps, before it
was time&mdash;he disliked himself heartily. He
felt vaguely that, whatever had happened, he
had had something to do with it. He had
had more to do with it than he guessed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
do my best&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rsquo; he promised;
and he meant his &lsquo;best&rsquo; to be better than
that of the smartest detective at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
He left Alfred, shut himself up alone,
and reviewed the situation. An hour&rsquo;s hard
thinking led to a rather ingenious interview&mdash;one
with the girl Bunn. It took place on
the stairs, of all places. Granville saw her
set foot upon the bottom stair; he immediately
sat down upon the top one, produced a newspaper,
and blocked the gangway.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bunn, you have a sweetheart in Australia.
Don&rsquo;t pout and toss your head; it&rsquo;s nothing
to be ashamed of&mdash;quite the contrary; and
it&rsquo;s the fact, I think&mdash;eh?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, Mr Granville, what if I have?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, nothing; only there is something
about it in this newspaper&mdash;about Australia,
I mean; not about you&mdash;that&rsquo;s to come. You
shall have the newspaper, Bunn; here it is.
I thought you&rsquo;d like it, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Bunn took the paper, all smiles and
blushes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you, Mr Granville. And&mdash;and
I beg your pardon, sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t name it, my good girl. But, look
here, Bunn; stay one moment, if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rsquo; (She could scarcely help staying, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
gave her no chance of passing; besides, he
had put her under an obligation.) &lsquo;Tell
me now, Bunn&mdash;didn&rsquo;t Mrs Alfred know
something about him? And didn&rsquo;t Mrs
Alfred talk to you a good deal about Australia?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That she did, sir. But she didn&rsquo;t know
my young man, Mr Granville. She only got
his address from me just as she was going
away, sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! she wanted his address before she
went away, did she?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir. She said she would name him
in writing to her father, or in speaking to
Mr Barrington, or that, any way, it&rsquo;d be nice
to have it, against ever she went out there
again, sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, she gave three reasons all in one,
eh? And did she say she&rsquo;d like to go out
again, Bunn?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She always said that, sir, between ourselves&mdash;&ldquo;between
you and I, Bella,&rdquo; it used
to be. But, time I gave her the address, she
went on as if she would like to go, and meant
a-going, the very next day.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
&lsquo;Yet she didn&rsquo;t like leaving this, even for
a week&mdash;eh, Bunn?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, no, sir! She spoke as if she was never
coming back no more. And she kissed me,
Mr Granville&mdash;she did, indeed, sir; though
I never named that in the servants&rsquo; hall.
She said there might be a accident, or somethink,
and me never see her no more; but
that, if ever she went back to Australia,
she&rsquo;d remember my young man, and get him
a good billet. Them were her very words.
But, oh, Mr Granville!&mdash;oh, sir!&mdash;--&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There, there. Don&rsquo;t turn on the waterworks,
Bunn. I thought Mrs Alfred had
been cut up about something; but I wasn&rsquo;t
sure&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I asked <em>you</em>, Bunn; though
I think, perhaps, you needn&rsquo;t name this conversation
either in the servants&rsquo; hall, or tell
any one else what you have told me. Yes,
you may go past now. But&mdash;stop a minute,
Bunn&mdash;here&rsquo;s something else that you needn&rsquo;t
name in the servants&rsquo; hall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The something else was a half-sovereign.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was worth it, too,&rsquo; said Granville,
when the girl was gone; &lsquo;she has given me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
something to go upon. These half-educated
and impulsive people always do let out more
to their maids than to any one else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went back to Alfred.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There was something I forgot to ask you.
How much money do you suppose Gladys
had about her when she went away?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have no idea,&rsquo; said Alfred.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you know how much money you
have given her since you have been over&mdash;roughly?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; I don&rsquo;t know at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think, man. Fifty pounds?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should say so. I gave her a note or so
whenever it struck me she might want it.
She never would ask.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you think she spent much?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t tell you, Gran; perhaps not
a great deal, considering everything; for,
when I was with her, I never would let her
shell out. I never knew of her spending
much; but she had it by her, in case she
wanted it; and that was all I cared about.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And that was all Granville cared about.
He ceased his questioning; but he was less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
ready to leave Alfred alone than he had been
before. He had found him sitting in the
dark by the open window, and staring blankly
into the night. Granville had insisted on
lighting the gas: only to see how the room
was filled with Gladys&rsquo;s things. In every
corner of it some woman&rsquo;s trifle breathed of
her. Granville felt instinctively that much
of this room, in the present suspense, might
turn a better brain than Alfred&rsquo;s, in Alfred&rsquo;s
position.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said Granville, at last: &lsquo;I
have been thinking. Listen, Alfred.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Alfred absently, still gazing
out of window.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have got a theory,&rsquo; went on Granville&mdash;&lsquo;no
matter what; only it has nothing to say
to death or drowning. It is a hopeful theory.
I intend to practise it at once: in a day or
two it ought to lead me to absolute certainty
of one thing, one way or the other. No
matter what that one thing is; I have told
you what it is not. Now, I shall have to
follow out my idea in town; and if I find the
truth at all, I shall most likely come across it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
suddenly, round a corner as it were. So I
have been thinking that you may as well be
in town too, to be near at hand in case I am
successful. If you still have a club, you
might hang about there, and talk to men, and
read the papers; if not&mdash;&mdash; Why do you
shake your head?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not going to town any more,&rsquo; said
Alfred, in low, decided tones. &lsquo;If you are
right, and she is not dead, she may come
back&mdash;she may come back! Then I shall be
here to meet her&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; But you
understand me, Gran?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not very well,&rsquo; said Granville, dryly, and
with a shrug of his shoulders that was meant
to shift from them all responsibility for
Alfred&rsquo;s possible insanity. &lsquo;In your case I
should prefer to be in town rather than here.
However, a man judges for himself. There
is one thing, however; if you stay here all
day&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The question whether you should tell the
Judge and the <i>mater</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Alfred, resolutely; &lsquo;I shall not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
tell them&mdash;not, that is, until the worst is
known for certain. They think she is at the
Barringtons&rsquo;. I shall say I have heard from
her. I would tell a million lies to save them
the tortures of uncertainty that I am suffering,
and shall suffer, till&mdash;till we know the
worst. Oh, Granville!&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, find
it out quickly!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already told you I
would,&rsquo; said Granville almost savagely; and
he left the room.</p>

<p>Granville&rsquo;s best, in matters that required
a clear head and some little imagination, was
always excellent. In the present instance his
normal energies were pushed to abnormal
lengths by the uncomfortable feeling that he
himself had been not unconcerned in bringing
about that state of unhappiness which
alone could have driven his sister-in-law to
her last rash, mysterious step; by a feverish
desire to atone, if the smallest atonement
were possible; and by other considerations,
which, for once, were unconnected with the
first person singular. Nevertheless, on the
Wednesday&mdash;the day following the foregoing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
conversation&mdash;he found out nothing at all;
and nothing at all on the Thursday. Then
Alfred made up his mind that nothing but
the very worst could now come to light, and
that that was only a question of time; and he
fell into an apathy, by day, that Granville&rsquo;s
most vigorous encouragement, in the evening,
could do nothing to correct. Thus, when the
news did come, when the terrible suspense
was suddenly snapped, Alfred was, perhaps, as
ill-prepared for a shock (though he had expected
one for days) as it was possible for
a man to be.</p>

<p>It was on the Friday night. Lady Bligh
and Sir James were deep in their game of
<i>bezique</i>. Alfred sat apart from them, without
a hope left in his heart, and marvellously
altered in the face. His pallor was terrible,
but perhaps natural; but already his cheekbones,
which were high, seemed strangely
prominent; and the misery in his large still
eyes cried out as it sometimes does from the
eyes of dumb animals in pain. He was conscious
of his altered looks, perhaps; for he
sedulously avoided looking his parents in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
face. They did not know yet. It added to
his own anguish to think of the anguish that
must come to them too, sooner or later&mdash;sooner
now&mdash;very soon indeed.</p>

<p>The door opened. Granville entered, with
a brisk, startling step, and a face lit up&mdash;though
it was Granville&rsquo;s face&mdash;with
news.</p>

<p>Alfred saw him&mdash;saw his face&mdash;and rose
unsteadily to his feet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Speak! Say you have found her! No&mdash;I
see it in your face&mdash;she is there. Let me
come to her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>As Alfred stepped forward, Granville recoiled,
and the light left his face.</p>

<p>Alfred turned to his parents. The Judge
had risen, and glanced in mute amazement
from one son to the other: both were pale,
but their looks told nothing. Lady Bligh sat
back in her chair, her smooth face
wrinkled with bewilderment and vague
terror.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is Gladys come back,&rsquo; said Alfred, in
tremulous explanation; &lsquo;it is only that
Gladys has come back, mother!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
Even then he chuckled in his sleeve to
think that they had never known, and never
need know, anything of this, the worst of his
wife&rsquo;s many and wild escapades.</p>

<p>But Granville recoiled still farther, and
his face became gray.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have not seen her,&rsquo; he said, solemnly.
&lsquo;She is <em>not</em> here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not seen her? Not here?&rsquo; Alfred was
quickly sobered. &lsquo;But you know where
she is? I see it in your face. She is
within reach&mdash;eh? Come, take me to
her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is not even within reach,&rsquo; Granville
answered, squeezing out the words by a
strenuous effort. &lsquo;I cannot take you to her.
Gladys sailed for Australia last Monday
morning!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alfred sunk heavily into a chair. No one
spoke. No one was capable of speech. Before
any one had time to think, Alfred was
on his feet again, tottering towards the
door.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must follow!&rsquo; he whispered, in hoarse,
broken tones. &lsquo;I will follow her to-night!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
Stand aside, Gran; thanks; and God bless
you! Good-bye! I shall know where to
find her out there. I have no time to
stop!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Granville stood aside in obedience; but
for one instant only: the next&mdash;he sprang
forward to catch in his arms the falling form
of Alfred.</p>



<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE BOUNDARY-RIDER OF THE YELKIN
PADDOCK</span></h2>


<p>Picture the Great Sahara. The popular
impression will do: it has the merit of simplicity:
glaring desert, dark-blue sky, vertical
sun, and there you are. Omit the mirage
and the thirsty man; but, instead, mix
sombre colours and work up the African desert
into a fairly desirable piece of Australian
sheep-country.</p>

<p>This, too, is a simple matter. You have
only to cover the desert with pale-green
saliferous bushes, no higher than a man&rsquo;s
knee; quite a scanty covering will do, so
that in the thickest places plenty of sand may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
still be seen; and there should be barren
patches to represent the low sand-hills and the
smooth clay-pans. Then have a line of low-sized
dark-green scrub at the horizon; but bite
in one gleaming, steely speck upon this sombre
rim.</p>

<p>Conceive this modification of the desert,
and you have a fair notion of the tract of
country&mdash;six miles by five&mdash;which was
known on Bindarra Station as the &lsquo;Yelkin
Paddock,&rsquo; the largest paddock in the &lsquo;C
Block.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Multiply this area by six; divide and subdivide
the product by wire fences, such as
those that enclose the Yelkin Paddock; water
by means of excavations and wells and
whims; stock with the pure merino and
devastate with the accursed rabbit; and
(without troubling about the homestead, which
is some miles north of the Yelkin) you will
have as good an idea of the Bindarra &lsquo;run,&rsquo;
as a whole, as of its sixth part, the paddock
under notice.</p>

<p>The conspicuous mark upon the distant
belt of dingy low-sized forest&mdash;the object that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
glitters in the strong sunlight, so that it can
be seen across miles and miles of plain&mdash;is
merely the galvanised-iron roof of a log-hut,
the hut that has been the lodging of the
boundary-rider of the Yelkin Paddock ever
since the Yelkin Paddock was fenced.</p>

<p>A boundary-rider is not a &lsquo;boss&rsquo; in the
Bush, but he is an important personage, in
his way. He sees that the sheep in his paddock
&lsquo;draw&rsquo; to the water, that there is water
for them to draw to, and that the fences and
gates are in order. He is paid fairly, and has
a fine, free, solitary life. But no boundary-rider
had ever stopped long at the Yelkin
hut. The solitude was too intense. After a
trial of a few weeks&mdash;sometimes days&mdash;the
man invariably rolled up his blankets, walked
in to the homestead, said that there was
moderation in all things, even in solitude, and
demanded his cheque. The longest recorded
term of office in the Yelkin Paddock was six
months; but that boundary-rider had his
reasons: he was wanted by the police.
When, after being captured in the hut, this
man was tried and hanged for a peculiarly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
cold-blooded murder, the Yelkin post became
even harder to fill than it had been
before.</p>

<p>During the Australian summer following
that other summer which witnessed the
events of the previous chapters, this post was
not only filled for many months by the same
boundary-rider, but it was better filled than
it had ever been before. Moreover, the
boundary-rider was thoroughly satisfied, and
even anxious to remain. The complete
solitude had been far less appreciated by the
gentleman with the rope round his neck; for
him it had terrors. The present boundary-rider
knew no terrors. The solitude was
more than acceptable; the Crusoe-like existence
was entirely congenial; the level breezy
plains, the monotonous procession of brilliant,
blazing days, and the life of the saddle and
the hut, were little less than delightful, to the
new boundary-rider in the Yelkin. They
were the few pleasures left in a spoilt
life.</p>

<p>There could have been no better cabin
for &lsquo;a life awry&rsquo; (not even in the Bush, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
living sepulchre of so many such) than the
Yelkin hut. But it was not the place to forget
in. There are, however, strong natures
that can never forget, and still live on. There
are still stronger natures that do not seek to
forget, yet retain some of the joy of living side
by side with the full sorrow of remembrance.
The boundary-rider&rsquo;s was one of these.</p>

<p>The boundary-rider saw but few faces
from the home-station; none from anywhere
else. But, one glowing, hot-wind day, early
in January, a mounted traveller entered the
Yelkin Paddock by the gate in the south
fence. He was following the main track to
the homestead, and this track crossed a
corner of the Yelkin Paddock, the corner
most remote from the hut. He did not seem
a stranger, for he glanced but carelessly at
the diverging yet conterminous wheel-marks
which are the puzzling feature of all Bush
roads. He was a pallid, gaunt, black-bearded
man: so gaunt and so pallid, indeed, that
no one would have taken him at the first
glance, or at the second either, for Alfred
Bligh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
Yet it was Alfred&mdash;straight, virtually, from
his sick-bed. As soon as he could stand
(which was not for weeks) he had been taken
on board the steamer. The voyage, it was
hoped, would do him good, and he was bent on
going&mdash;to find his wife. It did not do him
much good; the eyes that swept at last the
territory of his father-in-law were the sunken,
wistful eyes of a shattered man.</p>

<p>Nothing had been heard of Gladys. Granville,
indeed, had written to Bindarra, but there
had been no reply. Of this Alfred had not been
informed. From the first moments of returning
consciousness he had expressed himself
strongly against writing at all.</p>

<p>So, as he crossed the corner of the
Yelkin Paddock, all he knew was that
Gladys had sailed for Australia six months
before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If she is here, she is here,&rsquo; he muttered a
hundred times; &lsquo;and there will have been
no warning of my coming to frighten her away.
If she is not here&mdash;if she were dead&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>His eyes dropped upon the bony hand
holding the reins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
&lsquo;Well, it would be an easier matter to
follow her there than here. It would take
less time!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But, as often as this contingency presented
itself, his thin hand involuntarily tightened
the reins. Indeed, the nearer he got to the
homestead the slower he rode. Many a
thousand times he had ridden in fancy this
last stage of his long, long journey, and always
at a hand-gallop; but, now that he was riding
it in fact, he had not the courage to press on.
He let his tired horse make the speed, and even
that snail&rsquo;s pace was, at moments, too quick
for him.</p>

<p>At the hour wherein he needed his utmost
nerve to meet his fate&mdash;his nerve, and the
stout heart that had brought him, weak as he
was, from the opposite end of the earth, were
failing him.</p>

<p>The gate in the west fence was in sight,
when Alfred, awaking from a fit of absence,
became aware that a man with a cylinder of
rolled blankets upon his back (his &lsquo;swag&rsquo;)
was tramping along the track to meet him.
For a moment Alfred&rsquo;s heart thumped; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
would know his fate now; this man, who was
evidently from the home-station, would tell
him. Then he recognised the man. It was
Daft Larry, the witless stockman, who, being
also stone deaf, was incapable of answering
questions.</p>

<p>Larry was a short man, strongly built
though elderly, and probably less old than he
looked. He had a fresh complexion, a short
gray beard, and eyes as blue (and as expressionless)
as the flawless southern sky. He
recognised Alfred, stood in his path, threw
down his swag, put his hands in his pockets,
and smiled delightedly; not in surprise; in
mere idiotic delight. On beholding Alfred,
this had been his invariable behaviour. They
had beheld one another last a year ago;
but last year and yesterday were much the
same date to Larry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I like a man that is well-bred!&rsquo; exclaimed
Larry, with a seraphic smile, his head critically
on one side. On beholding Alfred, this
had been his invariable formula.</p>

<p>Alfred stopped his horse.</p>

<p>Daft Larry cocked his head on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
side. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not one of the low sort!&rsquo; he
went on.</p>

<p>Alfred smiled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>You&rsquo;re</em> well-bred,&rsquo; continued Larry, in the
tone of a connoisseur. Then, wagging his
head gravely: &lsquo;I like a man that&rsquo;s not one
of the low sort; I like a man that is well-bred!&rsquo;</p>

<p>That was the end, as it always had been.
Larry picked up his swag with the air of a
man who has proved his case.</p>

<p>Alfred had ridden on some yards, when
a call from the idiot made him stop.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look there!&rsquo; shouted Larry, with an
ungainly sweep of the arm. &lsquo;Dust-storm
coming up&mdash;bad dust-storm. Don&rsquo;t get
catched, mister&mdash;you aren&rsquo;t one of the low sort&mdash;not
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Daft Larry had been known to give gratuitous
information before, though he could not
answer questions. Alfred, instead of riding
on, now looked about him. There was sense
enough in the warning; though Larry,
apparently, did not mind being &lsquo;catched&rsquo;
himself, since he was plodding steadily on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
leaving the station, probably for good, as he
periodically did leave it. There was every
indication of a dust-storm, though the sun
still shone brilliantly. The hot-wind had
become wild and rampant. It was whipping
up the sandy coating of the plain in every
direction. High in the air were seen whirling
spires and cones of sand&mdash;a curious effect
against the deep-blue sky. Below, puffs of
sand were breaking out of the plain in every
direction, as though the plain were alive with
invisible horsemen. These sandy cloudlets
were instantly dissipated by the wind; it was
the larger clouds that were lifted whole into
the air, and the larger clouds of sand were
becoming more and more the rule.</p>

<p>Alfred&rsquo;s eye, quickly scanning the horizon,
descried the roof of the boundary-rider&rsquo;s hut
still gleaming in the sunlight. He remembered
the hut well. It could not be farther
than four miles, if as much as that, from this
point of the track; but it was twelve miles
at least from this to the homestead. He also
knew these dust-storms of old; Bindarra was
notorious for them. Without thinking twice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
Alfred put spurs to his horse and headed for
the hut. Before he had ridden half the distance,
the detached clouds of sand banded
together in one dense whirlwind; and it was
only owing to his horse&rsquo;s instinct that he did
not ride wide of the hut altogether; for,
during the last half mile, he never saw the
hut until its outline loomed suddenly over
his horse&rsquo;s ears; and by then the sun was
invisible.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never saw one come on quicker!&rsquo; gasped
Alfred, as he jumped off and tethered his
quivering horse in the lee of the hut.</p>

<p>The excitement, and the gallop, had made
Alfred&rsquo;s blood tingle in his veins. It was a
novel sensation. He stepped briskly into the
hut.</p>

<p>Almost his first sight on entering was the
reflection of his own face in a little mirror,
which was neatly nailed to the wall, close to
the door. Alfred had never been vain, but he
did pause to gaze at himself then; for his face
was covered with a thin veneer of sand, as
a wall becomes coated with driven snow. He
dashed off the sand, and smiled; and for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
moment, with some colour in his cheeks and
a healthy light in his eyes, Alfred scarcely
knew himself. Then he turned his back upon
the glass, merely noting that it was a queer
thing to find in a boundary-rider&rsquo;s hut, and
that it had not been there a year ago.</p>

<p>The door had been ajar, and the window
was blocked up. The sand, however, had
found free entry through the crevices between
the ill-fitting pine-logs of the walls,
and already the yellow coating lay an eighth
of an inch thick all over the boarded floor
and upon the rude bench and table.</p>

<p>Alfred sat down and watched the whirling
sand outside slowly deepen in tint. He had
left the door open, because otherwise the
interior of the hut would have been in complete
darkness. As it was, it was difficult
to distinguish objects; but Alfred, glancing
round, was struck with the scrupulous tidiness
of everything.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ration-bags all hung up; nothing left
about; fireplace cleaned out&mdash;daily, I should
say; pannikins bright as silver; bunk made
up. All this is most irregular!&rsquo; exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
Alfred. &lsquo;This boundary-rider must be a curiosity.
I never saw anything half so neat
during all the months I was in the Bush
before. One might almost suspect a woman&rsquo;s
hand in it&mdash;especially in that mirror. Which
reminds me, Gladys told me she was once out
here for a week, alone, riding the boundaries,
when they were short-handed. My darling!
What nerve! Would to Heaven you had had
less nerve!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The thick sand rattled in continuous
assault upon the iron roof. It was becoming
a difficult matter to see across the hut. But the
storm, and the gallop, had had a curiously
exhilarating effect upon Alfred. His spirits
had risen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish that boundary-rider would come
in; but the storm&rsquo;s bound to fetch him. I
want a pannikin of tea badly, to lay the dust
inside; there&rsquo;s as much there as there was
outside, I&rsquo;ll be bound. Besides, he will have
news for me. Poor Larry!&mdash;the same old
drivel! And to think that I was something
like that in my delirium&mdash;that I might have
been left like Larry!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
His attention was here attracted by the
illustrated prints pasted upon a strip of sackcloth
nailed to the pine-logs over the bunk:
a feature, this, of every bushman&rsquo;s hut. He
went over to look at them, and, the better to
do so, leant with one knee upon the bed&mdash;the
rudely-framed bed that was so wonderfully
well &lsquo;made.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; remarked Alfred, &lsquo;some of them
are the old lot; I remember them. But some
are new, and&mdash;why, that&rsquo;s a cabinet photograph
down there by the pillow; and&rsquo;&mdash;bending
down to examine it&mdash;&lsquo;good Heavens!
it&rsquo;s of <em>me</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was a fact. The photograph, fixed so
close to the pillow, was an extremely life-like
one of Alfred Bligh. But how had it got
there? Of what interest or value could it be
to the boundary-rider of the Yelkin Paddock?
It had been taken last summer, at Richmond;
and&mdash;oh, yes, he remembered now&mdash;Gladys
had sent one out to her father. That was it,
of course. The boundary-man had found it
lying about the veranda or the yard at the
homestead (Alfred knew his father-in-law),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
and had rescued it for the wall of his hut.
No matter (to the boundary-man) who it was,
it was a picture, and one that would rather
set off the strip of sackcloth. That was it, of
course; a simple explanation.</p>

<p>Yet Alfred trembled. The photograph
was in a far from conspicuous position; nor
did it look as if it had been left lying about.
What if it belonged to Gladys? What if
Gladys had fastened it there with her own
hands? What if she came sometimes to the
hut&mdash;this hut in which he stood? What if
she had spent another week here riding the
boundaries, when her father was short of men?</p>

<p>All at once he felt very near to her; and the
feeling made him dizzy. His eyes roved
once again round the place, noting the abnormal
neatness and order that had struck him
at first; a look of wild inquiry came into
his haggard face; and even then, as the agony
of surmise tightened every nerve&mdash;a sound
broke plainly upon his ears. It was heard
above the tinkle of the sand upon the roof:
a horse&rsquo;s canter, muffled in the heavy sand
outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
Alfred sprang to the door. At the same
instant a rider drew rein in front of him.
They were not five paces apart, but such
was the density of the flying sand and dust
that he could see no more than the faint outline
of the horse and its rider. Then the rider
leapt lightly to the ground. It was the
boundary-rider of the Yelkin Paddock; but
the boundary-rider was a woman.</p>

<p>Alfred reeled forward, and clasped her to
his heart.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladdie! Darling!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had found her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">ANOTHER LETTER FROM ALFRED</span></h2>


<p class="addright">&lsquo;Bindarra Station, N.S.W., <i>April 13</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>,&mdash;Your dear letter, in
answer to my first, written in January, has
just reached me. Though I wrote so fully
last mail, I can&rsquo;t let a mail go without some
sort of an answer. But, as a matter of fact,
I am in a regular old hurry. The mail-boy
is waiting impatiently in the veranda, with
his horse &ldquo;hung up&rdquo; to one of the posts; and
the store keeper is waiting in the store to drop
my letter in the bag and seal it up. So
I must be short. Even with lots of time,
however, you know I never could write
stylish, graphic letters like Gran can. So
you must make double allowances for me.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And now, dear mother, about our coming
back to England; and what you propose;
and what you say about my darling. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
take the best first&mdash;God bless you for your
loving words! I can say nothing else. Yes,
I knew you were getting to love her in spite
of all her waywardness; and I know&mdash;I <em>know</em>&mdash;that
you would love her still. And you
would love her none the less for all that has
happened; you would remember what I
explained in my first letter, that it was <em>for
my sake</em>; you would think no longer of what
she did, but why she did it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, about coming back, we have, as
you already know, made up our minds to live
out our lives here in Australia. After all, it&rsquo;s
a far better country&mdash;a bigger and a better
Britain. There is no poverty here, or very
little; you never get stuck up for coppers in
the streets of the towns; or, if you do, it&rsquo;s
generally by a newly-landed immigrant who
hasn&rsquo;t had time to get out of bad old habits.
There&rsquo;s more room for everybody than at
home, and fairer rations of cakes and ale all
round. Then there&rsquo;s very little ill-health,
because the climate is simply perfect&mdash;which
reminds me that <em>I</em> am <em>quite</em> well now&mdash;have
put on nearly two stone since I landed!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
But all this about Australia&rsquo;s beside the mark:
the real point is that it suits Gladdie and me
better than any other country in the world.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now for some news. We have decided
upon our station at last. It is the one in
Victoria, in the north-eastern district&mdash;&mdash; I
think I mentioned it among the &ldquo;probables&rdquo;
in my last. It is not large as stations go;
but &ldquo;down in Vic&rdquo; you can carry as many
sheep to the acre as acres to the sheep up
here in the &ldquo;back-blocks.&rdquo; You see, it is a
grass country. But the scenery is splendid:
great rugged ranges covered with the typical
gum-trees, of which there are none up here,
and a fine creek clean through the middle of
the &ldquo;run.&rdquo; Then there are parrots and &rsquo;possums
and native bears all over the place, none
of which you get up here, though I fear there
will be more snakes too. The only drawback
is the &ldquo;cockatoos.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean the <em>bird</em>,
dear mother, but the &ldquo;cockatoo selectors.&rdquo;
Personally, I don&rsquo;t think these gentry are the
vermin my father-in-law makes them out to
be; <em>he</em> brackets them with the rabbits; but <em>I</em>
mean to make friends with them&mdash;if I can.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
The homestead is delightful: good rooms,
and broad veranda round three sides. We
are going to be absurdly happy there.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We shall not take possession though till
after shearing&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in your autumn, though
the agreement is signed and everything
arranged. Meanwhile, we shall stay on here,
and I am to get a little more Colonial experience.
I need it badly, but not perhaps so
badly as my father-in-law makes out. He
ridiculed the idea of my turning squatter on
my own account, unless Gladys was &ldquo;boss.&rdquo;
But, now that we have fixed on the Victorian
station, he is a bit more encouraging. He
says any fool could make <em>that</em> country pay,
referring of course to the rainfall, which just
there, in the ranges, is one of the best in
Australia. Still, he is right: experience <em>is</em>
everything in the Colonies.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So I am not quite idle. All day I am
riding or driving about the &ldquo;run,&rdquo; seeing
after things, and keeping my eyes open. In
the evenings Gladdie and I have taken to
reading together. This was her doing, not
mine, mind; though I won&rsquo;t yield to her in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
my liking of it. The worst of it is, it&rsquo;s so difficult
to know where to begin; <em>I</em> am so painfully
ignorant. Can <em>you</em> not help us, dear
mother, with some hints? Do!&mdash;and when
we come home some day (just for a trip) you
will find us both such reformed and enlightened
members of society!</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, long before that, <em>you</em> must come out
and see <em>us</em>. Don&rsquo;t shake your head. <em>You
simply must.</em> England and Australia are
getting nearer and nearer every year. The
world&rsquo;s wearing small, like one of those round
balls of soap, between the hands of Time&mdash;(a
gem in the rough this, for Gran to polish and
set!) Why, there&rsquo;s a Queensland squatter who
for years has gone &ldquo;home&rdquo; for the hunting
season; while, on the other hand, Australia is
becoming <em>the</em> crack place to winter in.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, as you, dear mother, always <em>do</em>
winter abroad, why not here as well as anywhere
else? You must! You shall! If not
next winter, then the following one; and if
the Judge cannot bring you, then Gran must.
That reminds me: how are they both? And
has Gran been writing anything specially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
trenchant lately? I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t appreciate
very &rsquo;cutely&mdash;&ldquo;miss half the &lsquo;touches,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he used to tell me (though I think I have
made him a present of a &ldquo;touch&rdquo; to-day).
But you know how glad we would both be to
read some of his things; so <em>you</em> might send
one sometimes, dear mother, without him
knowing. For we owe him so much! And,
besides what he did for me afterwards, he
was always so nice and brotherly with Gladys.
I know she thought so at the time, though
she doesn&rsquo;t speak about him much now&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t think why. <em>You&rsquo;re</em> the one she thinks
of most, dearest mother; you&rsquo;re her model
and her pattern for life!</p>

<p>&lsquo;The mail-boy has begun to remonstrate.
He&rsquo;ll have to gallop the whole way to the
&ldquo;jolly&rdquo; township, he says, if I am not quick.
So I must break off; but I will answer your
dear letter more fully next mail, or, better
still, Gladdie shall write herself. Till then,
good-bye, and dearest love from us both.</p>

<p class="sig">&lsquo;Ever your affectionate son,<br />
<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
&lsquo;PS.&mdash;Gladys has read the above: so one
last word on the sly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, mother, if you only saw her at this
moment! She is sitting in the veranda&mdash;I
can just see her through the door. She&rsquo;s in
one of those long deck-chairs, with a book,
though she seems to have tired of reading.
I can&rsquo;t see much of her face, but only the
sweep of her cheek, and the lashes of one
lid, and her little ear. But I can see she
isn&rsquo;t reading&mdash;she&rsquo;s threading her way through
the pines into space somewhere&mdash;perhaps
back to Twickenham, who knows? And
she&rsquo;s wearing a white dress; you would like it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
plain. And her cheek is quite brown;
you&rsquo;ll remember how it was the day she landed
from the launch. But there! I can&rsquo;t describe
like Gran, so it&rsquo;s no good trying. Only I do
know this: I simply love her more and more
and more, and a million times more for all
that has happened. And you, and all of you,
and all your friends, would fairly worship
her now. You couldn&rsquo;t help it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
